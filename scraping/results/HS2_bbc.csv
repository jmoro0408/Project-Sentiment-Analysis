0,HS2 rail bridge set to be installed in Stechford,"The bridge is being built by Network Rail in partnership with HS2 to enable tracks for Britain's new zero-carbon railway to be built underneath. Once installed in Stetchford, it will become the longest single-span railway structure in the West Midlands allowing HS2 to access its new depot. Over the May Bank Holiday, the old section of the Stechford to Aston freight line above was demolished. The bridge has been assembled by contractor Skanska in the past 22 months in a huge compound beside the existing railway lines. Patrick Crawley, from Network Rail, said: ""The important task this bridge does for us is it allows HS2 Ltd to access their new depot facility at Washwood Heath. ""HS2 will use that depot to put their trains onto the new carbon zero rail network when it opens in a few years time. ""Eighteen months of work all comes together this weekend, we have closed the railway the last two or three weekends to prepare for this, we are on schedule and this bridge should drive in over the course of Saturday night into Sunday morning."" A total of 18 transporter vehicles will drive the 2,600 tonne metal and concrete bridge into place before tracks are re-laid so trains can run again on Monday. To carry out the work safely, CrossCountry services between Birmingham New Street and Coleshill Parkway are being replaced with rail replacement buses. Passengers are urged to plan their journeys in advance.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-61363594,2022-05-07
1,HS2: Sir Graham Brady 'assured' link through constituency scrapped,"The 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady confirmed Grant Shapps had told him the Golborne Link would be dropped. The line would link HS2 with the West Coast Mainline through Sir Graham's Altrincham and Sale West constituency. The Department For Transport said no decision had been made and it could not comment on a ""private conversation"".  reported that Sir Graham had recently written to a constituent and told them Mr Shapps had given him ""categorical verbal assurances"" that the line, which is also known as the Golborne Spur, would be removed from the HS2 bill currently going through Parliament. Sir Graham later confirmed his comments to the BBC. The HS2 bill for the section between Crewe and Manchester   and included the Golborne Link, which would also pass through the Tatton, Makerfield, Leigh and Warrington North and South constituencies. Andy Carter, the Conservative MP for Warrington South, said he, Sir Graham and Leigh MP James Grundy had repeatedly argued for route changes. He said there were ""better ways to connect Manchester with the North and Scotland than via the Golborne Spur"". ""I understand work is under way to publish an alternative route and I will certainly be supportive of any Government amendments,"" he added. HS2, which has been estimated to be costing between £72bn and £98bn, was originally meant to build high-speed rail links between London and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. In November 2021, Mr Shapps announced that the  . Work is under way on phase one of the project, connecting London and Birmingham, and that part of the line is due to open by 2033. A second phase will extend the line to Crewe, with the final phase, which will also pass through Sir Graham's constituency, taking HS2 to Manchester by 2040.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-61024652,2022-04-07
2,Acquitted HS2 protester in Lichfield 'should be convicted',"Elliott Cuciurean dug and occupied a tunnel on farmland in Hanch, Lichfield, Staffordshire, in March last year. The director of public prosecutions has appealed against his acquittal, following a trial in September. Judges said it was ""immaterial"" land targeted by a protest was only a small part of the HS2 high-speed rail scheme. They stated Mr Cuciurean, who had been acquitted of aggravated trespass, should be remitted to magistrates with ""a direction to convict"" him. Following a trial at City of London Magistrates' Court in September, a judge concluded prosecutors had not made her sure a conviction was a ""necessary and proportionate interference"" with his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This was despite costs of removing him and other protesters over three days reaching about £195,000. Lawyers for Mr Cuciurean had relied on a June ruling by the Supreme Court, which overturned convictions of four protesters who were charged with obstruction of the highway, after locking themselves together outside an arms fair in 2017. They argued the judgment raised the issue of whether a ""proportionality test"" should be used in cases of non-violent protest - where potential conviction is weighed against its impact on article 10 and 11 rights. The director of public prosecutions appealed against the acquittal, with the original judge asking the High Court to rule over whether applying the Supreme Court judgment allowed her to acquit him. She also asked whether she was entitled to take into account ""the very considerable costs of the whole HS2 scheme and the length of time that is likely to take to complete"" when deciding if a conviction was necessary. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, sitting with Mr Justice Holgate, said the answers to these questions were ""no"". They concluded the ECHR rights ""do not sanction a right to use guerrilla tactics endlessly to delay and increase the cost of an infrastructure project which has been subjected to the most detailed public scrutiny"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-60946480,2022-03-31
3,HS2 protesters waiting for eviction to begin after papers served,"HS2 Ltd had served evictions papers demanding they vacate the site near Swynnerton by 24 March. But the group said it was not expecting to get moved on straight away, had no plans to leave voluntarily and would resist any forced eviction. One of the protesters, Steph, said: ""They'll probably leave it for a few weeks and just hope that we get bored."" They are opposing the construction of the high speed railway between Fradley and Crewe. The  , which spoke to the protesters, said they had dug a tunnel and built tree houses to make any eviction more difficult. There are also a large number of wooden pallets, which they said they would use to construct a tower. Steph said he had no idea when that might come and added: ""At some camps, it could be as soon as the end of the notice has come about, but sometimes they'll leave it for months on end."" He said the waiting can cause ""a lot of stress"". ""I really like to now what I'm up in the next week, and coming months, so I really don't know when that's the situation, when we've got an eviction hanging over our heads,"" he said. ""It's just a really beautiful woodland and it needs to stay, so I'll do what I can to keep it here."" Another protester, Nigel, said he had past experience of evictions. ""Tunnel bailiffs are usually really good. They'll work with people, because it's all about safety. ""We're not deliberately putting ourselves in the way of danger, but we will put ourselves in a position where we think we can protect a tree or a piece of land."" He said as well as slowing the progress of the work, he hoped protest camps like this one would help build public awareness. A spokesperson for HS2 Ltd said the line, once operational, would ""provide zero-carbon rail travel from day one"" and urged protesters to leave the encampments.

5,HS2's Euston Station to have bronze or gold-coloured roof,"Designers hope the ""innovative"" structure will be an ""identifying feature"" of the north London terminus. Its design will maximise the amount of natural light that reaches the concourse below, HS2 said. Declan McCafferty, lead architect for HS2 at Euston, said computer-generated images appear ""either bronze or gold... depending on which screen you look on"". Mr McCafferty, a partner at Grimshaw Architects, said anodized aluminium could be used for the roof to ""bring a little bit of warmth"". The roof will ""rise up in the centre to create a really dramatic vaulted form"", he explained. ""The roof height is to encourage natural ventilation. It pulls the warm air out of the station and naturally ventilates the passenger spaces below. ""It has reflectors on either side which reflect light down deep into those passenger spaces. ""In as low-carbon a way as possible, it's about creating the best environment for users of the station."" Andrew Stephenson, HS2 minister, announced in October last year that the number of HS2 platforms at Euston will be cut from 11 to 10 following the recommendations of the  HS2 intends to maintain planned peak frequencies of 17 trains per hour at the station despite the reduction in platforms, but some rail experts have warned this will affect punctuality. The updated plan means the redevelopment of Euston will be completed in one stage, rather than two. Mr Stephenson said: ""The arrival of HS2 at Euston provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to create an iconic destination in the area, that will help us build back better by growing not just the economy of London but that of the UK.""

They said the landscaping works would help integrate the railway into the surrounding area. Campaigners, however, say the plans are just ""window dressing"".  HS2 says trains will travel through the area in a 400-metre (0.24-mile) tunnel that will replace, and follow the route of, an existing public path, Kenilworth Greenway. The path is used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders, and is set to be re-routed to make way. Under plans, the tunnel will be turned green by way of new growth, with planting also used to help shield the line from the realigned Kenilworth Greenway, HS2 says.  It adds a service building, near to where trains enter the tunnel, is set to be built in a bowl-shaped area, planted with trees and shrubs so it is not easily visible, with the building also due a green roof.

The   said that as part of the work to take HS2 from Crewe to Manchester, Metrolink services along the Ashton-under-Lyne to Eccles route would be suspended to allow realignment works to be carried out from 2024 at the earliest. A temporary track would be needed and a ""turn back"" would be created at Manchester Piccadilly railway station until the new tram stop there became fully functional. As a result, a replacement bus service would be put on between Ashton-under-Lyne and Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. Mr Gwynne said while he understood the work around Piccadilly would be ""massively disruptive for years to come, we can't have a situation where this line is mothballed and replaced by a bus replacement service"". ""The Metrolink line to Ashton is a crucial piece of public transport infrastructure to Tameside,"" he added. He said he would be tabling amendments to the new HS2 bill going through Parliament to ensure Transport for Greater Manchester's ""preferred option of at least running trams between New Islington and Ashton becomes the preferred option"". ""This would require a new depot building at Ashton Moss to park the trams when not in use, but in the big scheme of bringing HS2 to Manchester, it's not an unreasonable ask for the people who rely on this vital transport link,"" he said.

10,HS2 plans conveyor belt across A413 in Buckinghamshire,"HS2 Ltd said it was looking to build a temporary structure to move earth over the A413, near Wendover, and the Chiltern rail line. It said it would reduce the number of journeys by lorries carrying earth. Buckinghamshire Council said it was looking at what planning applications would need to be submitted.  to create better rail links between London and other major cities that would cut journey times and increase capacity. The council said HS2 Ltd wanted to install the conveyer belt near Small Dean as part of its ""mass haul strategy"" to move earth from the Small Dean Viaduct launch compound, across the A413 London Road and the rail line over to Small Dean Lane. It would be used for two years with an aim to ""drastically reduce the number of truck movements on the A413"", the council said. Without the conveyor, there would be an estimated 200 lorries per day over a period of three and half years. Buckinghamshire Council said as well as investigating what planning applications would need to be submitted it would also be ""seeking reassurances, from HS2 and its contractors, that any impacts on the community, such as light and noise, are minimised"". HS2 Ltd said cuttings were planned for the area south of the A413 and the material excavated needs to be moved north to help form embankments and noise barriers elsewhere on the route. Senior project manager, Patrick Dineen, said HS2 was ""committed to cutting the amount of embedded carbon in construction and working to reduce the number of lorries on local roads"". ""The fully-enclosed 600m long conveyor will avoid the need to transport excavated material on the public road network,"" he said.

Archaeologist Iain Williamson said it was an ""amazing discovery"".  The carved figure is wearing tunic-like clothing which ends above the knee.  Mr Williamson, an archaeologist for HS2 contractor Fusion JV, described it as ""extremely rare"" and added: ""The preservation of details carved into the wood, such as the hair and tunic, really start to bring the individual depicted to life.""

A team of about 80 archaeologists have been working on the site for a year and discovered numerous artefacts, including more than 300 Roman coins. Site manager James West said it was ""extraordinary and tells us so much about the people who lived here"". The site, known as Blackgrounds after the black soil found there, is near the villages of Edgcote and Chipping Warden. Archaeologists said it was an Iron Age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, believed to have been established in about 400 BC, that developed into a wealthy Roman trading town. Discoveries showed the settlement expanded over time, becoming more prosperous during the Roman period, with new stone buildings and roads being built. The team uncovered a 10m (33ft) wide Roman road, described as ""exceptional in its size"", running through the site.  HS2 archaeologists found evidence of workshops, kilns, several ""beautifully preserved wells"" and fiery red-coloured earth, which indicates activities such as bread-making and metal work occurred. Alongside the coins found, glass vessels, highly decorative pottery, jewellery and evidence of make-up was uncovered. Traces of the mineral galena - lead sulphide - a substance that was crushed and mixed with oil as make-up, was found on the site, archaeologists said. Mr West said it was one of the ""most impressive sites"" Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) had discovered working on HS2.

16,HS2: Transport for Wales boss wants equivalent funding for Wales,"Transport for Wales (TfW) chief James Price said the railways needed significant investment but it was ""very difficult to do"" without more cash. The UK government's own analysis estimated HS2 would have   on Wales.  The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would bring more frequent trains. HS2 is a  , with not a single inch of track laid in Wales. It is currently classified as an England and Wales project by officials in Westminster, meaning the Welsh government does not receive a proportionate amount of what is known as a top-up ""Barnett consequential"". ""Clearly, I don't think that's right,"" said Mr Price. ""If you look at the figures, some of the UK government's own figures suggest that whilst HS2 is good for the country as a whole, it's not necessarily good for Wales. ""And in order for it to be good for Wales, Wales needs to invest significantly in rail infrastructure and without those consequentials, obviously, it's very difficult to do that."" Mr Price called for full ""consequentials"" from HS2 to come to Wales. The Welsh government and a cross-party group of MPs have called   as an England-only project. A report by the Commons' Welsh affairs select committee said the Welsh government received ""approximately £755m in Barnett consequentials"" between 2015 and 2019 as result of DfT spending money on HS2. However, because the project is classed as ""England and Wales"", it would ""not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials"". The report also said HS2 could ""yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancement to the north Wales mainline"". When the UK government decides to spend more or less on public services in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much money the other nations receive. This sum is called the Barnett consequential. It reflects differences in population size plus the range of devolved public services in each nation.  Since this money is not ringfenced, the devolved governments are free to spend the consequential on services other than the UK government's area of spending.

From a climate change perspective, Mr Price added: ""My personal view is that we will have to see Network Rail and the UK government electrify the rest of the network in Wales.  ""At the minute there looks like there's very little other technology that's available to do it."" He added electrification beyond current plans for the London line to Cardiff and the valleys lines ""does feel like something that we absolutely need"". Mr Price has said he is ""not happy"" with   on Welsh trains. Speaking to  , he said Wales' current service was ""probably a mid-tier UK rail system which, when we think about it, compared to the best in the world is probably not very good and we want to do a whole lot better, which is why we are on a journey to try and transform rail across Wales"". The pandemic has resulted in a drop in rail passengers, with current numbers ""above 71% of pre-Covid"" use of Welsh services, according to Mr Price. But he said the figures were ""varying massively across the network, so some parts of the network are far busier than they were before, some parts of the network are less busy"". In June, it was announced TfW would get another £70m of taxpayers' funding to make up for a drop in passenger numbers,   from the Welsh government. Mr Price said: ""Until we get back up to around 100%, the extra subsidy that was coming in will have to continue to come in or we'll have to run less services."" The DfT said HS2 would ""provide faster and more frequent train services to Wales"", with the interchange at Crewe bringing ""many parts"" of the country within two-and-a-quarter hours of London.

With the announcement that the line has been axed and replaced with a new Integrated Rail Plan, the Shimmer estate may have escaped its certain fate. But it is a shadow of what it once was. ""It's depressing,"" said one renter, who asked to remain anonymous. They've lived here a few months and said the rent was cheap but the estate was dying. The roads are unfinished, playgrounds are fenced off and gardens are overgrown. But it wasn't meant to be like this. ""It's nice and a quiet area,"" one new renter said, gesturing towards the back of the estate. ""You can walk your dog down to the canal."" The 49-year-old, who did not want to give his name but agreed to be pictured, has only lived here for three weeks, moving from nearby Conisbrough. ""There's a few sold up thinking it was going ahead, and a lot just panicked,"" he said. He now hopes more people will come back and breathe life back into the estate, adding: ""I've met a few people who seem quite friendly and quite nice."" More than 200 new homes have been built since the estate began in 2011, but the threat of an 18m (60ft) high viaduct looming over their gardens was too much for many. It led to HS2 becoming the largest land and property owner in Mexborough, according to political party Mexborough First. ""People who live on here have been left in complete limbo,"" local councillor Andy Pickering said. ""We still don't know where we are with it."" Councillor Pickering said HS2 had treated people badly, offering less than the market value for properties. ""Neighbours didn't know what next door was being offered. It's been a disgraceful affair."" The government has previously said HS2   for both the taxpayer and homeowners. Along the path of the proposed HS2 line, along the M18 and past fields that would have seen trains traveling up to 250mph, road signs to other nearby villages are like a roll call of worried and angry communities, many of whom set up action groups against HS2. Some are saying the change in plans has been a win, but a couple of people on Shimmer are still trying to sell their homes. One person told me they are now waiting for answers over what happens next, hoping they will be bought so they can start a new life. ""This estate has been in turmoil,"" councillor Sean Gibbons said. ""There's only one or two homeowners who are still here."" He said people who still live here don't want to talk about their experiences over fears for the future, with renters worried about upsetting their landlords. ""You've got representatives of the government bullying them into taking a deal they don't want. That's how they've approached it."" A few people on the estate had no idea about the axed HS2 proposals. They had only rented here for a few months and saw their stay as short-term. Work wouldn't have started on the eastern leg until 2033 at the earliest and not all of the houses on the estate would have been demolished to make way for the line. For them, today was just another day. ""Mexborough is the forgotten town,"" said one woman, whose sister lives in a property that would be in the shadow of the viaduct. She said she wasn't surprised to hear the project had been curtailed, adding: ""We live up north, we never get anything, do we?""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-59331515,2021-11-18
18,HS2 residents: 'Our street has been saved for now',"But for residents of one Derbyshire road, the mood was bittersweet. People with homes in Bonsall Street, in the town of Long Eaton, have lived with the threat of the wrecking ball for almost a decade. About 70 properties on the street were facing demolition to make way for a 15m (49ft) viaduct to carry HS2 trains to what was to be the regional hub for the line in Toton, Nottinghamshire. But under the latest plans, the HS2 line will end at East Midlands Parkway - approximately eight miles (12.8km) south of Long Eaton - meaning residents are hopeful their street has been saved - for now. Elaine Fletcher, 66, has lived on the road for 19 years. She said: ""In one way I'm really glad. I didn't want to move from here after so many years."" However, she added she was frustrated the years in limbo had left her unable to develop her home. ""With it being under compulsory purchase I didn't want to spend money on it when we thought it was going to be knocked down,"" she said. ""For example, I've not redone the windows or the kitchen. It's been incredibly frustrating."" Residents on the street say they have heard little from the authorities about the project  . ""In a way I am happy but I am also annoyed that it has taken so long. If I'd known one way or the other, I could have planned,"" said Ms Fletcher. She was also wary about the official vision changing once more. At present, HS2 trains will connect with the cities of Nottingham and Derby via a planned upgrade to the current Midlands Mainline and Toton will get a mainline hub. What these improvements are likely to mean for Long Eaton and the surrounding communities is unclear. ""They've made a decision now but what about in 10 years' time?"" said Ms Fletcher. ""They could do it all over again. ""Are they going to take the compulsory purchase order off the houses? If they do, would people want to buy them in case they do the railway expansion?"" Linda Edwards, 61, another resident of the road, said she was pleased about the announcement. ""I don't want to move,"" she said. ""We've lived here for 42 years now. HS2 has been a worry. ""We've not heard anything from them for years and you end up not knowing what you're doing - do you decorate, stuff like that."" She spoke with sadness of longstanding neighbours who had moved away. ""A lot of them didn't want to go,"" she said. And the fact some politicians have suggested the creation of an Eastern leg may not be off the cards in the long-term have left her questioning how far she trusted the decision. ""This is what they say today - but you don't know,"" she said. Valerie Richardson, 64, was one of those neighbours who left the street when her home of 30 years was sold under the compulsory purchase scheme. Today, her house is being rented to tenants while she lives elsewhere in the town. ""It's been very stressful,"" she said. ""Now someone else is in it when I could have just stayed all along. ""It's a relief [HS2] is not coming through Long Eaton but my first thought when I heard this morning was that I moved for nothing."" Kerry Hickton, 47, said her partner's home had been earmarked for demolition due to the HS2 development. ""For the past seven years, the house has been falling apart and we've not done anything to it,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, it was going to be knocked down. ""We've waited so long now everything is in disrepair. We put everything on hold. It's nice to know it's not being demolished but it puts a lot of people in a difficult situation."" Conversely Robert Gascoigne, 73, decided not to sell the home he had lived in for 50 years, which was also due to be demolished - because he never expected the line to be built. ""It's not a surprise to me - it's been put back so many times,"" he said. ""It's the right decision. But it's nice to know."" Announcing its plan, the Department for Transport said the improvements it intended to make would speed up connectivity to towns such as Long Eaton. ""Under earlier plans, smaller towns on existing main lines... would have seen little improvement, and in some cases even their services cut back,"" it said in a statement. ""The Integrated Rail Plan will protect and improve these crucial links and will deliver improvements with far less disruption to local communities.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-59333321,2021-11-18
19,"HS2: New plan a betrayal of the North, say critics","Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the eastern leg of HS2 - running from the Midlands to Leeds - had been cut. MPs have also accused the government of breaking promises over Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a raft of upgrades and additions to the network. Mr Shapps said the new Integrated Rail Plan would bring benefits much sooner. Boris Johnson doubled down on the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project after he became prime minister, and would later include it as a manifesto promise. In 2019 Mr Johnson pledged ""to fund the Leeds to Manchester route"" and ""turbo-charge the economy"". The government insists it is still delivering NPR through additional investment, and said upgrades to existing routes would cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans. Some have said the new announcement marks a significant shift away from previous plans and recommendations, with politicians and businesses in some northern cities angry at the government's changes. The HS2 line was due to be extended from the West Midlands to Leeds. This would have cut journey times between London and Leeds to one hour and 21 minutes.  MPs from Yorkshire said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had repeatedly promised that HS2 and a new Leeds-Manchester line going via Bradford as part of NPR would be ""built in full"". However, HS2 will only be built as far as a new East Midlands Parkway station, about six miles south-west of Nottingham. That means London-Leeds journey times will be one hour and 53 minutes, some 32 minutes longer than planned. The government has not ruled out bringing HS2 to Leeds, but no timescale has been given. The dropping of the Leeds to Manchester NPR plan means Bradford will miss out on inclusion along the new line. Ministers have promised upgrades to the existing links between the cities and shorter journey times. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said the promise to build the new line to Manchester had been broken ""and Leeds and the North have been betrayed"". Adding to Mr Benn's criticism of the plans was Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford. The city had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains. Mr Moore said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents. ""We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,"" he said. ""I still want to see Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered with a main stop in Bradford, so that we can unlock our economic opportunities."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), which represents rail workers, concluded that Bradford would be ""the biggest loser"". It said Bradford had been found to have the worst transport connections of any UK city due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. A report out earlier this week found the city had the worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said the plan showed the government had ""sold out the North with more broken promises"". In June, Transport for the North recommended that new lines should be built between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester and Bradford. A high-speed line will instead be built between Warrington, in Cheshire, and Marsden, on the West Yorkshire border. Existing lines on the remainder of the route between Liverpool and Leeds will be upgraded. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham described it as ""second best for the North again"". ""What we are hearing today [is] part new line, part upgrades; that isn't what we were promised and that isn't good enough,"" he said. ""I am thinking about everyone living here today, but what about the people's grandchildren and great grandchildren. We are going to saddle them with the wrong railway system for centuries."" In Sheffield and surrounding towns and cities, concerns were raised about damage to the countryside and disturbance of local communities as a result of HS2's construction. The high-speed service will still run to Sheffield, but the announcement it would not go further was cautiously welcomed in some areas. Chris Read, Labour leader of Rotherham Council, which has lobbied against plans to route HS2 through the area, said the U-turn was a ""victory for common sense at last"", but urged ministers to keep their promises on the scale of investment in northern rail services. But the new announcement has brought uncertainty in some places, such as the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, near Doncaster. It was due to be demolished to make way for the eastern leg, and many homeowners left when they learned an 60ft (18m) high viaduct was due to be built to carry high-speed lines. After the announcement, local councillor Andy Pickering said those who remained had been ""left in complete limbo"". The Integrated Rail Plan has effectively ""wiped Hull off the mainline rail map"", according to the Labour Party. The city had hoped the plan would include the electrification of the line between Hull and Selby, to improve its connection to the East Coast Mainline and cut journey times to Leeds. Hull's Labour leader, councillor Daren Hale, said it was an ""absolute scandal"" for ministers to say that journey times between Hull and Manchester would improve due to upgrades to the line between Leeds and Manchester. ""Yet again the people of Hull and this area have been overlooked,"" he said. Politicians in Hull are expecting to meet with rail ministers to discuss the announcement and repeat their demands for direct improvements. If life is about comprises then a very big one has just been put upon northern England. It doesn't have the same train commuter culture as south east England because the stations and rail lines aren't there but it does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will also improve. There's a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in trans pennine terms. £96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-59333867,2021-11-18
20,M42 shuts over Christmas for HS2 bridge preparation,"The M42 will be affected in both directions from junction nine for Sutton Coldfield, Lichfield and Coleshill to junction 10 for Tamworth and Nuneaton. The Marston Box bridge, to be installed later next year, will carry the high speed rail line north of Birmingham. The road will close from 21:00 GMT on Christmas Eve to Friday 31 December.  The structure will be the UK's first ""box-slide"" bridge over a motorway and will take the line across the motorway north of Lea Marson and Curdworth in North Warwickshire, said HS2 Ltd. It will connect to Dunton Wood Embankment to the south and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Viaduct, which crosses the canal, to the north. The 10,000 tonne structure will be built on land next to the motorway then moved into position in winter 2022, the company said.  Traffic will be diverted along the A446, A453 and A5 roads with National Highways advising drivers to prepare for some disruption.

21,Scrapping HS2 Leeds extension 'undermines' levelling up,"The comments come as sources have told the BBC  . James Lewis, leader of Leeds, said the decision reinforced the ""old north-south divide"". The new Northern Powerhouse Line is also expected to be abandoned in favour of upgrades to existing lines. The Integrated Rail Plan is expected to be published by the government on Thursday. It is understood the government is set to argue the new plans will deliver comparable benefits more quickly and cheaply. Mr Lewis said: ""We believe that anything less than a commitment to the eastern leg of HS2 as part of an integrated network with Northern Powerhouse Rail in full would undermine any pledge to 'level up' our regions - at a time when we need it most."" In an open letter to the Prime Minister, Mayor of West Yorkshire Tracy Brabin urged him to ""keep his promises"" on rail. She said the government had a choice: ""It can choose to unlock the potential of the North, or it can let us down once again, limiting your levelling up ambitions, before you've had a chance to finalise the levelling up White Paper."" The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which represents northern council's and businesses, said the decision was a mistake and would undermine HS2 as a project to drive economic growth across the whole UK. There is also significant concern about the government ditching proposals for the new Northern Powerhouse Rail line, between Leeds and Manchester. The BBC understands the government plans to largely upgrade existing lines and the route would not go via Bradford. Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: ""Bypassing Bradford with its young and diverse population is the height of short-term Treasury thinking."" He said the idea that the revised plan would unlock the north's potential was ""misguided and, in economic terms, disastrous"".  ""Throwing money at 150-year-old tunnels towards Manchester because it will cost less, which will never have enough capacity as they and the wider route through Huddersfield is so constrained, is not Northern Powerhouse Rail,"" he added. For those who have campaigned against HS2 the suggestion the eastern leg has been ditched is welcome. Anne Brown, from Woodlesford, West Yorkshire, said it was a ""massive relief"". ""We stood to be completely decimated by HS2. It would have driven a hole through the village. ""The environmental impact would have been huge, the construction would have been a nightmare and we would have lost so much in terms of wildlife, our local amenities and the green areas."" For years residents had been unable to make long-term plans, unsure if they would lose their homes or be unable to sell them. ""Hopefully that is the end of that,"" Ms Brown said. For residents forced out of their homes on the Shimmer estate, at Mexborough, South Yorkshire, the decision has come too late. As of the end of 2020, the government had purchased 75 homes for potential demolition to make way for the line. Mexborough councillor Sean Gibbons said: ""What a waste this whole thing has been, it's only brought anxiety and misery for many who were living there. ""I'm distraught for them, it's all been in vain,"" he said. Sue Douglas was one of those who were forced to move from Mexborough, taking a financial loss on the sale of her home. ""We lost about £20,000,"" she said. She and her husband had only been in the home for two years when in 2016 they learned HS2 would be coming through the estate. She said the experience had made them ill, which was one of the reasons they decided to move on. ""It's an awful lot smaller than the one we had on the Shimmer estate,"" she said. Mrs Douglas said she was relieved it had been dropped, but wished it had never happened in the first place. ""Why did we have to go through all that, why did they have to put us through the trauma?"" Mr Lewis said the Prime Minister had said Northern Powerhouse Rail would do for the north what Crossrail would do for London. ""Crossrail is almost built, so cutting Northern Powerhouse Rail now would just reinforce the old north-south divide."" The Labour leader of Bradford Council, Susan Hinchcliffe said the decision, if it was as reported, did not make any sense. ""We are the biggest city in the country not connected to the mainline railway,"" she said. ""We know that the business case is there to make it economically very profitable for the whole of the north.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-59294034,2021-11-15
22,HS2: Toton in limbo waiting for transformation,"Toton, located between Nottingham and Derby, is the planned site of the East Midlands stop of the high-speed railway. However, the proposals - which include an innovation campus, a rail hub and garden villages - are now in doubt. The Department for Transport said the soon-to-be-published Integrated Rail Plan would clarify the situation. The selection of Toton back in 2013 as an HS2 hub, connecting Birmingham and Leeds, and servicing the cities of Nottingham and Derby, caught the eye as it was one of the few communities on the route that was not a major city. Since then, it has been the focus of proposals for huge investment and development. But the   means it is not clear how much of this will go ahead. ""We're in limbo and it isn't good for anyone,"" said Graham Heal, 67, speaking to the BBC on a muddy path through trees that could one day lead to the rail hub. He has lived in Toton for 10 years and believes the project will make a ""massive"" change to the area, nearly doubling it in size and attracting a younger demographic. ""We've got about 6,000 houses in Toton at the moment and they're planning another 4,000,"" he said.  ""Of course there are people who don't want to see this huge shake-up and they want to know for certain if they need to move out quickly and let other people move in. ""Let's get it sorted out now, one way or the other."" Richard Hutchinson, 48, who chairs the area's neighbourhood forum, said HS2 would mean Toton would see ""development like it's never seen before"", but ""nothing has changed"" since it was first announced. ""There's been pockets of development,"" he added. ""But nothing on the scale we're talking about over the next 20 to 30 years if HS2 and the rest of the development comes to the area. ""It's frustrating to a lot of people - stakeholders, us, the community - they can't move forwards, they don't understand what's going to happen. ""People want to be communicated to, they want to understand the plans so they can plan their lives around it. ""Let's stop discussing and let's get a decision and allow people to get moving."" Mark Shelton, 25, who was born and raised in Toton, has just bought a house in nearby Long Eaton. He said: ""There was a lot of discussion about HS2. ""I was going to put an offer in on one but then they said it might be backing on to the garden and I had to think 'Will I be able to sell it for the same price in the future? Will it drop or increase in value?' ""I bought a different one a bit further away for that reason. ""You've got to be careful. I think a lot of people are in the same situation, thinking about whether they want to move here, is it going to get too busy?"" Kun Darnley, 42, who lives in nearby Chilwell, said she was looking to buy in Toton but wanted to know where exactly the train tracks will go before doing so. She said: ""People who are looking to buy property round here, who have a family, there's concern about safety. ""I'm worried about the train tracks. I'd like to know where exactly they're going to build it and how they're going to keep kids safe."" Jonathan Grey, who has lived in Toton for 20 years, said the development will have a ""dramatic"" impact on the town. He said: ""I don't know why it's taking so long but I presume the wheels of government churn on quite slowly. ""There's not much more we can do as a community in preparation, but when they announce if it's definitely going to happen then we can assess the full impact."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it remained ""committed"" to enabling the East Midlands to ""reap the benefits of high-speed rail services"". He added: ""The Integrated Rail Plan will soon outline exactly how major rail projects, including HS2 phase 2b and other transformational projects such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, will work together to deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the north and midlands need and deserve."" Until then, residents will just have to wait to find out the fate of their town.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58909524,2021-10-15
23,"HS2: What is the route, when will it be finished and what will it cost?","The announcement is part of the government's £96bn rail programme - although only about half is new investment. HS2 is a massive project intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. It will cost tens of billions of pounds and is aimed at cutting journey times and increasing capacity.  It's hoped HS2 will create jobs and grow the UK economy outside London. But HS2 has faced delays and mounting concerns over the exact route and spiralling costs. HS2 was originally meant to connect   with  ,   and  . Work has already started on the first phase, linking London and the West Midlands.  The next section will extend the line to Crewe. The final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. But the Leeds leg is being scrapped. This had been billed as reducing the journey time from London to Leeds by 50 minutes. Under the government's  : Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the measures will mean faster journeys up to 10 years earlier than planned. But opponents said he was watering down previous plans. The decision not to go ahead with the eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds goes back on previous government pledges. In May,   - and would be delivered earlier than planned.  ""We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,"" he said. He suggested the eastern leg could be brought forward ""quite dramatically"" by building it ""in a smarter way"". The government says HS2 will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, down to 52 minutes.  Once the second phase is complete, HS2 would also take an hour off journeys from Manchester to London. The plan for the eastern leg was to join HS2 to the existing East Coast Main Line, leading to significantly faster journey times. For example, travelling from London to Leeds currently takes two hours and 13 minutes. Under the HS2 plans it would have taken one hour and 21 minutes. The latest proposals mean it will take one hour and 53 minutes. Campaigners against HS2, including those living on the proposed route, have welcomed the news. Others are not happy. Labour's Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said Mr Johnson had ""repeatedly promised"" the new high-speed Leeds-Manchester line would be ""built in full"", adding: ""Leeds and the North have been betrayed"". The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, representing councils and businesses, said not including Bradford in the east-west upgrade would be ""disastrous"" in economic terms. The London and Birmingham leg was due to open at the end of 2026. But   between 2029 and 2033. The second phase was due to open in 2032-33, but has been pushed back to 2035-2040. The current estimated cost of HS2 is between £72bn and £98bn (at 2019 prices), compared with an original budget of £55.7bn in 2015 (at 2015 prices).  But this was made before the decision was taken to cancel the Leeds leg. Management issues and unrealistic land valuations caused costs to spiral.   Former executive Doug Thornton previously told BBC Panorama initial estimates for buying property and land were "" "". A 2019 Freedom of Information request revealed that property costs are forecast to reach £5bn, compared to the original £1.1bn estimate. HS2 also failed to carry out extensive soil surveys, causing problems for digging and excavation, according to the project's former chairman, Allan Cook. HS2 has faced a lot of opposition - much of it to do with the environmental impact. Pressure group Stop HS2 believes it will increase carbon emissions and damage areas of natural beauty. Protesters, including  , have built tunnels in an attempt disrupt HS2 construction. Supporters of HS2 say it will help cut the number of cars and lorries on the motorways, and reduce the demand for domestic flights.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16473296,2021-11-18

0,Evictions begin at HS2 protest camp in Staffordshire,"About 40 people have been living at the site just off the A51, near Swynnerton, for about a year, demonstrating against plans to cut down woods for the line. Dozens of security staff have been brought in to ""safely remove"" the protesters, about 10 of whom say they have locked themselves inside the site. HS2 said it would create a new wildlife habitat. But the campaigners say felling ancient trees is not justified. The company issued the camp with an eviction notice in March. However, some people are refusing to leave. When the notice was served,  One of the activists who was evicted, David Buchan, said protesters were ""planning to stay there as long as they can"". ""They've got plenty of food and water so they could stay there quite a while if they wanted to,"" he said. ""Hopefully even if we don't stop HS2, we cause enough trouble to make them think twice about doing something so destructive and stupid again."" As well as the 10 people who have locked themselves in, five people are understood to have gone down into tunnels where they hope it will be harder for security teams to reach them. Others have also scaled trees as HS2 staff surround the woodland with the aim of enforcing a 10m cordon. Police have closed part of the A51 after protesters clashed with security officers.  One activist was seen breaking through one of the fences which HS2 has erected around the camp and there was a reportedly an altercation between gathered campaigners and security officers. HS2 urged the activists to ""leave immediately"" in the interests of safety. A spokesperson added: ""Anyone who cares about our natural environment ought to support a project that is providing work across the UK today, and in the future will get people out of cars, off planes and onto zero carbon rail travel."" The company has already started works on the site, bringing fencing, building tracks and putting up portable toilets. Environmental activists are also refusing to leave a second smaller camp nearby. Dozens of protesters have been living at the woodland camp for more than a year and join a number of people who have campaigned against the rail line due to environmental concerns. Pressure group Stop HS2 believes it will increase carbon emissions and damage areas of natural beauty. However, HS2 insists on its environmental credentials. Last year,   in a protest against the development. Later, the government is to set out plans to crack down on ""guerrilla protests"" which will make it illegal to obstruct major transport works including HS2.

1,HS2 tunnel fire: Workers shelter in digger near Maple Cross,"The ""small"" fire on Tuesday evening involved a vehicle used to ferry staff in and out of the Chiltern Tunnel near Maple Cross in Hertfordshire. HS2 Ltd confirmed three workers took shelter on a tunnel boring machine in a safety chamber and nobody needed hospital treatment. It said the tunnel was safely evacuated once the fire had been put out. An HS2 spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that the emergency services attended an incident at the HS2 Chiltern Tunnel South Portal site yesterday evening.  ""An investigation into the incident is ongoing. All personnel are safe and accounted for."" A Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said: ""Having established that everybody was safe, firefighters worked with the on-site specialists to extinguish the fire and ventilate smoke and gas from the tunnel. Firefighters remained on site overnight."" The boring machine was not damaged by the fire, which was about a mile (1.6km) away, and the company said staff followed usual safety procedures by staying in a safety chamber until the incident was under control. HS2 is a multi-billion-pound project intended to create   between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England.

2,HS2 rail bridge set to be installed in Stechford,"The bridge is being built by Network Rail in partnership with HS2 to enable tracks for Britain's new zero-carbon railway to be built underneath. Once installed in Stetchford, it will become the longest single-span railway structure in the West Midlands allowing HS2 to access its new depot. Over the May Bank Holiday, the old section of the Stechford to Aston freight line above was demolished. The bridge has been assembled by contractor Skanska in the past 22 months in a huge compound beside the existing railway lines. Patrick Crawley, from Network Rail, said: ""The important task this bridge does for us is it allows HS2 Ltd to access their new depot facility at Washwood Heath. ""HS2 will use that depot to put their trains onto the new carbon zero rail network when it opens in a few years time. ""Eighteen months of work all comes together this weekend, we have closed the railway the last two or three weekends to prepare for this, we are on schedule and this bridge should drive in over the course of Saturday night into Sunday morning."" A total of 18 transporter vehicles will drive the 2,600 tonne metal and concrete bridge into place before tracks are re-laid so trains can run again on Monday. To carry out the work safely, CrossCountry services between Birmingham New Street and Coleshill Parkway are being replaced with rail replacement buses.

3,HS2: Sir Graham Brady 'assured' link through constituency scrapped,"The 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady confirmed Grant Shapps had told him the Golborne Link would be dropped. The line would link HS2 with the West Coast Mainline through Sir Graham's Altrincham and Sale West constituency. The Department For Transport said no decision had been made and it could not comment on a ""private conversation"".  reported that Sir Graham had recently written to a constituent and told them Mr Shapps had given him ""categorical verbal assurances"" that the line, which is also known as the Golborne Spur, would be removed from the HS2 bill currently going through Parliament. Sir Graham later confirmed his comments to the BBC. The HS2 bill for the section between Crewe and Manchester   and included the Golborne Link, which would also pass through the Tatton, Makerfield, Leigh and Warrington North and South constituencies. Andy Carter, the Conservative MP for Warrington South, said he, Sir Graham and Leigh MP James Grundy had repeatedly argued for route changes. He said there were ""better ways to connect Manchester with the North and Scotland than via the Golborne Spur"". ""I understand work is under way to publish an alternative route and I will certainly be supportive of any Government amendments,"" he added. HS2, which has been estimated to be costing between £72bn and £98bn, was originally meant to build high-speed rail links between London and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. In November 2021, Mr Shapps announced that the  . Work is under way on phase one of the project, connecting London and Birmingham, and that part of the line is due to open by 2033. A second phase will extend the line to Crewe, with the final phase, which will also pass through Sir Graham's constituency, taking HS2 to Manchester by 2040.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-61024652,2022-04-07,2
4,Acquitted HS2 protester in Lichfield 'should be convicted',"Elliott Cuciurean dug and occupied a tunnel on farmland in Hanch, Lichfield, Staffordshire, in March last year. The director of public prosecutions has appealed against his acquittal, following a trial in September. Judges said it was ""immaterial"" land targeted by a protest was only a small part of the HS2 high-speed rail scheme. They stated Mr Cuciurean, who had been acquitted of aggravated trespass, should be remitted to magistrates with ""a direction to convict"" him. Following a trial at City of London Magistrates' Court in September, a judge concluded prosecutors had not made her sure a conviction was a ""necessary and proportionate interference"" with his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This was despite costs of removing him and other protesters over three days reaching about £195,000. Lawyers for Mr Cuciurean had relied on a June ruling by the Supreme Court, which overturned convictions of four protesters who were charged with obstruction of the highway, after locking themselves together outside an arms fair in 2017. They argued the judgment raised the issue of whether a ""proportionality test"" should be used in cases of non-violent protest - where potential conviction is weighed against its impact on article 10 and 11 rights. The director of public prosecutions appealed against the acquittal, with the original judge asking the High Court to rule over whether applying the Supreme Court judgment allowed her to acquit him. She also asked whether she was entitled to take into account ""the very considerable costs of the whole HS2 scheme and the length of time that is likely to take to complete"" when deciding if a conviction was necessary. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, sitting with Mr Justice Holgate, said the answers to these questions were ""no"". They concluded the ECHR rights ""do not sanction a right to use guerrilla tactics endlessly to delay and increase the cost of an infrastructure project which has been subjected to the most detailed public scrutiny"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-60946480,2022-03-31,2
5,HS2 protesters waiting for eviction to begin after papers served,"HS2 Ltd had served evictions papers demanding they vacate the site near Swynnerton by 24 March. But the group said it was not expecting to get moved on straight away, had no plans to leave voluntarily and would resist any forced eviction. One of the protesters, Steph, said: ""They'll probably leave it for a few weeks and just hope that we get bored."" They are opposing the construction of the high speed railway between Fradley and Crewe. The  , which spoke to the protesters, said they had dug a tunnel and built tree houses to make any eviction more difficult. There are also a large number of wooden pallets, which they said they would use to construct a tower. Steph said he had no idea when that might come and added: ""At some camps, it could be as soon as the end of the notice has come about, but sometimes they'll leave it for months on end."" He said the waiting can cause ""a lot of stress"". ""I really like to now what I'm up in the next week, and coming months, so I really don't know when that's the situation, when we've got an eviction hanging over our heads,"" he said. ""It's just a really beautiful woodland and it needs to stay, so I'll do what I can to keep it here."" Another protester, Nigel, said he had past experience of evictions. ""Tunnel bailiffs are usually really good. They'll work with people, because it's all about safety. ""We're not deliberately putting ourselves in the way of danger, but we will put ourselves in a position where we think we can protect a tree or a piece of land."" He said as well as slowing the progress of the work, he hoped protest camps like this one would help build public awareness. A spokesperson for HS2 Ltd said the line, once operational, would ""provide zero-carbon rail travel from day one"" and urged protesters to leave the encampments. They added the firm was planting seven million trees and shrubs between Birmingham and London, and was creating new wildlife habitats on the route to Crewe.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-60872444,2022-03-25,2
6,Eviction notice for Staffordshire HS2 protesters in woodland,"About 40 people live at the site, near Swynnerton, Staffordshire, after the Bluebell Woods Protection Camp group moved there almost a year ago. Several structures were built in trees and campaigners stated they had used ""things [that] would naturally go to waste"". HS2 Ltd said this spring it would start ""creating a new wildlife habitat"". The protection camp group has been taking the action, just off the A51, over phase 2a of the high-speed line from Fradley to Crewe Jim, from the group, said: ""We've got 10 years to stop, like, ecological collapse.  ""It's not just us saying this, this is all the scientists, that we can't be felling ancient woodlands. They might be tree planting, but you can't replace a 400-year-old oak, you just can't."" Railway engineer and writer Gareth Dennis said as an engineer and an environmentalist any loss of woodland was upsetting, but the ""extent, the lengths to which the design has avoided habitats, valuable habitats where it can is substantial"".  Mr Dennis, who lectures at Birmingham Centre for Railway Research and Education, added: ""I was recently visiting a tunnel that's been built to specifically avoid damaging ancient woodland. ""If you look on a map, the alignment curves, ducks and dives to avoid these sensitive habitats as best they can."" HS2 Ltd, the organisation delivering the railway, stated ""since the newest section was approved by MPs a year ago"" it had conducted more than 1,200 ground tests to develop a detailed picture of the area's geology ""which helps us to design and build the line"". It added this spring it would begin creating ""new wildlife habitat along the route"" between the West Midlands and Crewe, including planting 600,000 sq m of woodland.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-60748663,2022-03-15,2
7,HS2's Euston Station to have bronze or gold-coloured roof,"Designers hope the ""innovative"" structure will be an ""identifying feature"" of the north London terminus. Its design will maximise the amount of natural light that reaches the concourse below, HS2 said. Declan McCafferty, lead architect for HS2 at Euston, said computer-generated images appear ""either bronze or gold... depending on which screen you look on"". Mr McCafferty, a partner at Grimshaw Architects, said anodized aluminium could be used for the roof to ""bring a little bit of warmth"". The roof will ""rise up in the centre to create a really dramatic vaulted form"", he explained. ""The roof height is to encourage natural ventilation. It pulls the warm air out of the station and naturally ventilates the passenger spaces below. ""It has reflectors on either side which reflect light down deep into those passenger spaces. ""In as low-carbon a way as possible, it's about creating the best environment for users of the station."" Andrew Stephenson, HS2 minister, announced in October last year that the number of HS2 platforms at Euston will be cut from 11 to 10 following the recommendations of the  HS2 intends to maintain planned peak frequencies of 17 trains per hour at the station despite the reduction in platforms, but some rail experts have warned this will affect punctuality. The updated plan means the redevelopment of Euston will be completed in one stage, rather than two. Mr Stephenson said: ""The arrival of HS2 at Euston provides a once in a lifetime opportunity to create an iconic destination in the area, that will help us build back better by growing not just the economy of London but that of the UK.""

8,HS2: Tameside Council had 'no idea' railway could cut tram link,"Tameside Council's Brenda Warrington expressed her ""dismay"" at the possible removal of the service between Ashton-under-Lyne and Piccadilly Gardens in 2024. She said the council would ""definitely be petitioning"" against the proposal. A HS2 spokesperson previously said they aimed to ""limit disruption"".

Discussions were held about a   on the high-speed HS2 link between northern England, the Midlands and London, which is due to be completed at an estimated maximum of £98bn by 2040. Plans on the link between Crewe and Manchester were put before MPs on 24 January and are still going through the parliamentary process. Ms Warrington, leader of Tameside Council, said: ""I must on behalf of Tameside put on record, frankly, my dismay at the potential economic disadvantage that the severance of the Metrolink line would put us to. ""Whether it is for two years - it's more likely, I would say, a lot longer than that - it would have a significant negative impact on our ambitions for growth within Tameside."" She said there had been ""no discussion"" between the council and HS2 about the impact the plans would have on Metrolink route, which also serves Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. Local officials had ""no idea"" that the HS2 link would cut the Ashton tram line until a week before the plans were put to Parliament,"" she said. Metrolink amendment works are not expected to begin until at least 2024, when services on the Ashton-under-Lyne to Eccles route are expected to be suspended.

10,HS2 reveals Warwickshire 'green tunnel' plans,"Those behind the high speed railway said they were working on creating green spaces around the route through Burton Green, Warwickshire, following community feedback.  They said the landscaping works would help integrate the railway into the surrounding area. Campaigners, however, say the plans are just ""window dressing"".  HS2 says trains will travel through the area in a 400-metre (0.24-mile) tunnel that will replace, and follow the route of, an existing public path, Kenilworth Greenway. The path is used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders, and is set to be re-routed to make way. Under plans, the tunnel will be turned green by way of new growth, with planting also used to help shield the line from the realigned Kenilworth Greenway, HS2 says.  It adds a service building, near to where trains enter the tunnel, is set to be built in a bowl-shaped area, planted with trees and shrubs so it is not easily visible, with the building also due a green roof.  Steve Fancourt, HS2's senior landscape design manager, said: ""Our designs show how we will 'drape' the landscape over the tunnel by placing soil to conceal the tunnel roof to support new native woodland planting, reconnected wildlife corridors and new public footpaths.""

11,HS2: Cutting Tameside tram link for two years 'would be disastrous',"Labour's Andrew Gwynne said removing the service from Ashton-under-Lyne to Piccadilly Gardens in the second phase of the rail project was unacceptable. The MP for Denton and Reddish said the line was ""a crucial piece of public transport infrastructure to Tameside"". An HS2 spokesman said construction work would be ""phased to limit disruption"". The   said that as part of the work to take HS2 from Crewe to Manchester, Metrolink services along the Ashton-under-Lyne to Eccles route would be suspended to allow realignment works to be carried out from 2024 at the earliest. A temporary track would be needed and a ""turn back"" would be created at Manchester Piccadilly railway station until the new tram stop there became fully functional. As a result, a replacement bus service would be put on between Ashton-under-Lyne and Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester. Mr Gwynne said while he understood the work around Piccadilly would be ""massively disruptive for years to come, we can't have a situation where this line is mothballed and replaced by a bus replacement service"". ""The Metrolink line to Ashton is a crucial piece of public transport infrastructure to Tameside,"" he added. He said he would be tabling amendments to the new HS2 bill going through Parliament to ensure Transport for Greater Manchester's ""preferred option of at least running trams between New Islington and Ashton becomes the preferred option"". ""This would require a new depot building at Ashton Moss to park the trams when not in use, but in the big scheme of bringing HS2 to Manchester, it's not an unreasonable ask for the people who rely on this vital transport link,"" he said. The spokesman for HS2 said the project was ""committed to minimising disruption for Metrolink passengers"".

12,HS2 plans conveyor belt across A413 in Buckinghamshire,"HS2 Ltd said it was looking to build a temporary structure to move earth over the A413, near Wendover, and the Chiltern rail line. It said it would reduce the number of journeys by lorries carrying earth. Buckinghamshire Council said it was looking at what planning applications would need to be submitted.  to create better rail links between London and other major cities that would cut journey times and increase capacity. The council said HS2 Ltd wanted to install the conveyer belt near Small Dean as part of its ""mass haul strategy"" to move earth from the Small Dean Viaduct launch compound, across the A413 London Road and the rail line over to Small Dean Lane. It would be used for two years with an aim to ""drastically reduce the number of truck movements on the A413"", the council said. Without the conveyor, there would be an estimated 200 lorries per day over a period of three and half years. Buckinghamshire Council said as well as investigating what planning applications would need to be submitted it would also be ""seeking reassurances, from HS2 and its contractors, that any impacts on the community, such as light and noise, are minimised"". HS2 Ltd said cuttings were planned for the area south of the A413 and the material excavated needs to be moved north to help form embankments and noise barriers elsewhere on the route. Senior project manager, Patrick Dineen, said HS2 was ""committed to cutting the amount of embedded carbon in construction and working to reduce the number of lorries on local roads"". ""The fully-enclosed 600m long conveyor will avoid the need to transport excavated material on the public road network,"" he said. ""In total, the conveyor is expected to shift the equivalent of 58,000 lorry loads of material during construction, helping to reduce disruption for the community and other road users.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-60316497,2022-02-09,2

They initially thought the 67cm (26in) by 18cm (7in) figure was a degraded piece of wood, but as they excavated a humanlike shape was revealed. Archaeologist Iain Williamson said it was an ""amazing discovery"".  The carved figure is wearing tunic-like clothing which ends above the knee.  Mr Williamson, an archaeologist for HS2 contractor Fusion JV, described it as ""extremely rare"" and added: ""The preservation of details carved into the wood, such as the hair and tunic, really start to bring the individual depicted to life."" The lack of oxygen in the ditch helped preserve the wood over the centuries, although the figure's arms below the elbows and its feet have degraded. Shards of pottery found in the same ditch date to AD43-70, suggesting the figure was deposited in the early Romano-British period.

17,HS2: Transport for Wales boss wants equivalent funding for Wales,"Transport for Wales (TfW) chief James Price said the railways needed significant investment but it was ""very difficult to do"" without more cash. The UK government's own analysis estimated HS2 would have   on Wales.  The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would bring more frequent trains. HS2 is a  , with not a single inch of track laid in Wales. It is currently classified as an England and Wales project by officials in Westminster, meaning the Welsh government does not receive a proportionate amount of what is known as a top-up ""Barnett consequential"". ""Clearly, I don't think that's right,"" said Mr Price. ""If you look at the figures, some of the UK government's own figures suggest that whilst HS2 is good for the country as a whole, it's not necessarily good for Wales. ""And in order for it to be good for Wales, Wales needs to invest significantly in rail infrastructure and without those consequentials, obviously, it's very difficult to do that."" Mr Price called for full ""consequentials"" from HS2 to come to Wales. The Welsh government and a cross-party group of MPs have called   as an England-only project. A report by the Commons' Welsh affairs select committee said the Welsh government received ""approximately £755m in Barnett consequentials"" between 2015 and 2019 as result of DfT spending money on HS2. However, because the project is classed as ""England and Wales"", it would ""not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials"". The report also said HS2 could ""yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancement to the north Wales mainline"". When the UK government decides to spend more or less on public services in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much money the other nations receive. This sum is called the Barnett consequential. It reflects differences in population size plus the range of devolved public services in each nation.

18,HS2: Vast Roman settlement found by archaeologists,"The discovery was made during excavations at the site in south Northamptonshire. A team of about 80 archaeologists have been working on the site for a year and discovered numerous artefacts, including more than 300 Roman coins. Site manager James West said it was ""extraordinary and tells us so much about the people who lived here"". The site, known as Blackgrounds after the black soil found there, is near the villages of Edgcote and Chipping Warden. Archaeologists said it was an Iron Age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, believed to have been established in about 400 BC, that developed into a wealthy Roman trading town. Discoveries showed the settlement expanded over time, becoming more prosperous during the Roman period, with new stone buildings and roads being built. The team uncovered a 10m (33ft) wide Roman road, described as ""exceptional in its size"", running through the site.  HS2 archaeologists found evidence of workshops, kilns, several ""beautifully preserved wells"" and fiery red-coloured earth, which indicates activities such as bread-making and metal work occurred. Alongside the coins found, glass vessels, highly decorative pottery, jewellery and evidence of make-up was uncovered. Traces of the mineral galena - lead sulphide - a substance that was crushed and mixed with oil as make-up, was found on the site, archaeologists said. Mr West said it was one of the ""most impressive sites"" Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) had discovered working on HS2. He said the Blackgrounds area ""spans multiple time periods"" and had given the team several ""high-quality finds"". ""The site really does have the potential to transform our understanding of the Roman landscape in the region and beyond,"" he added. The history of the site features in   at 20:00 GMT, and on the iPlayer after broadcast. eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-59943179,2022-01-11,2
19,HS2: Housing estate in limbo after eastern leg axed,"A few months ago, the brand-new Shimmer estate in Mexborough near Doncaster was doomed. It was in the direct line of the eastern leg of HS2 - the high-speed rail link from the Midlands to Leeds - and was due to be demolished. Many of the homes here are empty. The ones that are occupied are rented, with just a handful still owned. With the announcement that the line has been axed and replaced with a new Integrated Rail Plan, the Shimmer estate may have escaped its certain fate. But it is a shadow of what it once was. ""It's depressing,"" said one renter, who asked to remain anonymous. They've lived here a few months and said the rent was cheap but the estate was dying. The roads are unfinished, playgrounds are fenced off and gardens are overgrown. But it wasn't meant to be like this. ""It's nice and a quiet area,"" one new renter said, gesturing towards the back of the estate. ""You can walk your dog down to the canal."" The 49-year-old, who did not want to give his name but agreed to be pictured, has only lived here for three weeks, moving from nearby Conisbrough. ""There's a few sold up thinking it was going ahead, and a lot just panicked,"" he said. He now hopes more people will come back and breathe life back into the estate, adding: ""I've met a few people who seem quite friendly and quite nice."" More than 200 new homes have been built since the estate began in 2011, but the threat of an 18m (60ft) high viaduct looming over their gardens was too much for many. It led to HS2 becoming the largest land and property owner in Mexborough, according to political party Mexborough First. ""People who live on here have been left in complete limbo,"" local councillor Andy Pickering said. ""We still don't know where we are with it."" Councillor Pickering said HS2 had treated people badly, offering less than the market value for properties. ""Neighbours didn't know what next door was being offered. It's been a disgraceful affair."" The government has previously said HS2   for both the taxpayer and homeowners. Along the path of the proposed HS2 line, along the M18 and past fields that would have seen trains traveling up to 250mph, road signs to other nearby villages are like a roll call of worried and angry communities, many of whom set up action groups against HS2. Some are saying the change in plans has been a win, but a couple of people on Shimmer are still trying to sell their homes. One person told me they are now waiting for answers over what happens next, hoping they will be bought so they can start a new life. ""This estate has been in turmoil,"" councillor Sean Gibbons said. ""There's only one or two homeowners who are still here."" He said people who still live here don't want to talk about their experiences over fears for the future, with renters worried about upsetting their landlords. ""You've got representatives of the government bullying them into taking a deal they don't want. That's how they've approached it."" A few people on the estate had no idea about the axed HS2 proposals. They had only rented here for a few months and saw their stay as short-term. Work wouldn't have started on the eastern leg until 2033 at the earliest and not all of the houses on the estate would have been demolished to make way for the line. For them, today was just another day. ""Mexborough is the forgotten town,"" said one woman, whose sister lives in a property that would be in the shadow of the viaduct. She said she wasn't surprised to hear the project had been curtailed, adding: ""We live up north, we never get anything, do we?""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-59331515,2021-11-18,2
20,HS2 residents: 'Our street has been saved for now',"But for residents of one Derbyshire road, the mood was bittersweet. People with homes in Bonsall Street, in the town of Long Eaton, have lived with the threat of the wrecking ball for almost a decade. About 70 properties on the street were facing demolition to make way for a 15m (49ft) viaduct to carry HS2 trains to what was to be the regional hub for the line in Toton, Nottinghamshire. But under the latest plans, the HS2 line will end at East Midlands Parkway - approximately eight miles (12.8km) south of Long Eaton - meaning residents are hopeful their street has been saved - for now. Elaine Fletcher, 66, has lived on the road for 19 years. She said: ""In one way I'm really glad. I didn't want to move from here after so many years."" However, she added she was frustrated the years in limbo had left her unable to develop her home. ""With it being under compulsory purchase I didn't want to spend money on it when we thought it was going to be knocked down,"" she said. ""For example, I've not redone the windows or the kitchen. It's been incredibly frustrating."" Residents on the street say they have heard little from the authorities about the project  . ""In a way I am happy but I am also annoyed that it has taken so long. If I'd known one way or the other, I could have planned,"" said Ms Fletcher. She was also wary about the official vision changing once more. At present, HS2 trains will connect with the cities of Nottingham and Derby via a planned upgrade to the current Midlands Mainline and Toton will get a mainline hub. What these improvements are likely to mean for Long Eaton and the surrounding communities is unclear. ""They've made a decision now but what about in 10 years' time?"" said Ms Fletcher. ""They could do it all over again. ""Are they going to take the compulsory purchase order off the houses? If they do, would people want to buy them in case they do the railway expansion?"" Linda Edwards, 61, another resident of the road, said she was pleased about the announcement. ""I don't want to move,"" she said. ""We've lived here for 42 years now. HS2 has been a worry. ""We've not heard anything from them for years and you end up not knowing what you're doing - do you decorate, stuff like that."" She spoke with sadness of longstanding neighbours who had moved away. ""A lot of them didn't want to go,"" she said. And the fact some politicians have suggested the creation of an Eastern leg may not be off the cards in the long-term have left her questioning how far she trusted the decision. ""This is what they say today - but you don't know,"" she said. Valerie Richardson, 64, was one of those neighbours who left the street when her home of 30 years was sold under the compulsory purchase scheme. Today, her house is being rented to tenants while she lives elsewhere in the town. ""It's been very stressful,"" she said. ""Now someone else is in it when I could have just stayed all along. ""It's a relief [HS2] is not coming through Long Eaton but my first thought when I heard this morning was that I moved for nothing."" Kerry Hickton, 47, said her partner's home had been earmarked for demolition due to the HS2 development. ""For the past seven years, the house has been falling apart and we've not done anything to it,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, it was going to be knocked down. ""We've waited so long now everything is in disrepair. We put everything on hold. It's nice to know it's not being demolished but it puts a lot of people in a difficult situation."" Conversely Robert Gascoigne, 73, decided not to sell the home he had lived in for 50 years, which was also due to be demolished - because he never expected the line to be built. ""It's not a surprise to me - it's been put back so many times,"" he said. ""It's the right decision. But it's nice to know."" Announcing its plan, the Department for Transport said the improvements it intended to make would speed up connectivity to towns such as Long Eaton. ""Under earlier plans, smaller towns on existing main lines... would have seen little improvement, and in some cases even their services cut back,"" it said in a statement. ""The Integrated Rail Plan will protect and improve these crucial links and will deliver improvements with far less disruption to local communities.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-59333321,2021-11-18,2
21,"HS2: New plan a betrayal of the North, say critics","Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the eastern leg of HS2 - running from the Midlands to Leeds - had been cut. MPs have also accused the government of breaking promises over Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a raft of upgrades and additions to the network. Mr Shapps said the new Integrated Rail Plan would bring benefits much sooner. Boris Johnson doubled down on the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project after he became prime minister, and would later include it as a manifesto promise. In 2019 Mr Johnson pledged ""to fund the Leeds to Manchester route"" and ""turbo-charge the economy"". The government insists it is still delivering NPR through additional investment, and said upgrades to existing routes would cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans. Some have said the new announcement marks a significant shift away from previous plans and recommendations, with politicians and businesses in some northern cities angry at the government's changes. The HS2 line was due to be extended from the West Midlands to Leeds. This would have cut journey times between London and Leeds to one hour and 21 minutes.  MPs from Yorkshire said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had repeatedly promised that HS2 and a new Leeds-Manchester line going via Bradford as part of NPR would be ""built in full"". However, HS2 will only be built as far as a new East Midlands Parkway station, about six miles south-west of Nottingham. That means London-Leeds journey times will be one hour and 53 minutes, some 32 minutes longer than planned. The government has not ruled out bringing HS2 to Leeds, but no timescale has been given. The dropping of the Leeds to Manchester NPR plan means Bradford will miss out on inclusion along the new line. Ministers have promised upgrades to the existing links between the cities and shorter journey times. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said the promise to build the new line to Manchester had been broken ""and Leeds and the North have been betrayed"". Adding to Mr Benn's criticism of the plans was Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford. The city had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains. Mr Moore said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents. ""We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,"" he said. ""I still want to see Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered with a main stop in Bradford, so that we can unlock our economic opportunities."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), which represents rail workers, concluded that Bradford would be ""the biggest loser"". It said Bradford had been found to have the worst transport connections of any UK city due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. A report out earlier this week found the city had the worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said the plan showed the government had ""sold out the North with more broken promises"". In June, Transport for the North recommended that new lines should be built between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester and Bradford. A high-speed line will instead be built between Warrington, in Cheshire, and Marsden, on the West Yorkshire border. Existing lines on the remainder of the route between Liverpool and Leeds will be upgraded. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham described it as ""second best for the North again"". ""What we are hearing today [is] part new line, part upgrades; that isn't what we were promised and that isn't good enough,"" he said. ""I am thinking about everyone living here today, but what about the people's grandchildren and great grandchildren. We are going to saddle them with the wrong railway system for centuries."" In Sheffield and surrounding towns and cities, concerns were raised about damage to the countryside and disturbance of local communities as a result of HS2's construction. The high-speed service will still run to Sheffield, but the announcement it would not go further was cautiously welcomed in some areas. Chris Read, Labour leader of Rotherham Council, which has lobbied against plans to route HS2 through the area, said the U-turn was a ""victory for common sense at last"", but urged ministers to keep their promises on the scale of investment in northern rail services. But the new announcement has brought uncertainty in some places, such as the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, near Doncaster. It was due to be demolished to make way for the eastern leg, and many homeowners left when they learned an 60ft (18m) high viaduct was due to be built to carry high-speed lines. After the announcement, local councillor Andy Pickering said those who remained had been ""left in complete limbo"". The Integrated Rail Plan has effectively ""wiped Hull off the mainline rail map"", according to the Labour Party. The city had hoped the plan would include the electrification of the line between Hull and Selby, to improve its connection to the East Coast Mainline and cut journey times to Leeds. Hull's Labour leader, councillor Daren Hale, said it was an ""absolute scandal"" for ministers to say that journey times between Hull and Manchester would improve due to upgrades to the line between Leeds and Manchester. ""Yet again the people of Hull and this area have been overlooked,"" he said. Politicians in Hull are expecting to meet with rail ministers to discuss the announcement and repeat their demands for direct improvements. If life is about comprises then a very big one has just been put upon northern England. It doesn't have the same train commuter culture as south east England because the stations and rail lines aren't there but it does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will also improve. There's a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in trans pennine terms. £96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-59333867,2021-11-18,2
22,Scrapping HS2 Leeds extension 'undermines' levelling up,"The comments come as sources have told the BBC  . James Lewis, leader of Leeds, said the decision reinforced the ""old north-south divide"". The new Northern Powerhouse Line is also expected to be abandoned in favour of upgrades to existing lines. The Integrated Rail Plan is expected to be published by the government on Thursday. It is understood the government is set to argue the new plans will deliver comparable benefits more quickly and cheaply. Mr Lewis said: ""We believe that anything less than a commitment to the eastern leg of HS2 as part of an integrated network with Northern Powerhouse Rail in full would undermine any pledge to 'level up' our regions - at a time when we need it most."" In an open letter to the Prime Minister, Mayor of West Yorkshire Tracy Brabin urged him to ""keep his promises"" on rail. She said the government had a choice: ""It can choose to unlock the potential of the North, or it can let us down once again, limiting your levelling up ambitions, before you've had a chance to finalise the levelling up White Paper."" The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which represents northern council's and businesses, said the decision was a mistake and would undermine HS2 as a project to drive economic growth across the whole UK. There is also significant concern about the government ditching proposals for the new Northern Powerhouse Rail line, between Leeds and Manchester. The BBC understands the government plans to largely upgrade existing lines and the route would not go via Bradford. Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: ""Bypassing Bradford with its young and diverse population is the height of short-term Treasury thinking."" He said the idea that the revised plan would unlock the north's potential was ""misguided and, in economic terms, disastrous"".  ""Throwing money at 150-year-old tunnels towards Manchester because it will cost less, which will never have enough capacity as they and the wider route through Huddersfield is so constrained, is not Northern Powerhouse Rail,"" he added. For those who have campaigned against HS2 the suggestion the eastern leg has been ditched is welcome. Anne Brown, from Woodlesford, West Yorkshire, said it was a ""massive relief"". ""We stood to be completely decimated by HS2. It would have driven a hole through the village. ""The environmental impact would have been huge, the construction would have been a nightmare and we would have lost so much in terms of wildlife, our local amenities and the green areas."" For years residents had been unable to make long-term plans, unsure if they would lose their homes or be unable to sell them. ""Hopefully that is the end of that,"" Ms Brown said. For residents forced out of their homes on the Shimmer estate, at Mexborough, South Yorkshire, the decision has come too late. As of the end of 2020, the government had purchased 75 homes for potential demolition to make way for the line. Mexborough councillor Sean Gibbons said: ""What a waste this whole thing has been, it's only brought anxiety and misery for many who were living there. ""I'm distraught for them, it's all been in vain,"" he said. Sue Douglas was one of those who were forced to move from Mexborough, taking a financial loss on the sale of her home. ""We lost about £20,000,"" she said. She and her husband had only been in the home for two years when in 2016 they learned HS2 would be coming through the estate. She said the experience had made them ill, which was one of the reasons they decided to move on. ""It's an awful lot smaller than the one we had on the Shimmer estate,"" she said. Mrs Douglas said she was relieved it had been dropped, but wished it had never happened in the first place. ""Why did we have to go through all that, why did they have to put us through the trauma?"" Mr Lewis said the Prime Minister had said Northern Powerhouse Rail would do for the north what Crossrail would do for London. ""Crossrail is almost built, so cutting Northern Powerhouse Rail now would just reinforce the old north-south divide."" The Labour leader of Bradford Council, Susan Hinchcliffe said the decision, if it was as reported, did not make any sense. ""We are the biggest city in the country not connected to the mainline railway,"" she said. ""We know that the business case is there to make it economically very profitable for the whole of the north.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-59294034,2021-11-15,2

24,HS2: Toton in limbo waiting for transformation,"Toton, located between Nottingham and Derby, is the planned site of the East Midlands stop of the high-speed railway. However, the proposals - which include an innovation campus, a rail hub and garden villages - are now in doubt. The Department for Transport said the soon-to-be-published Integrated Rail Plan would clarify the situation. The selection of Toton back in 2013 as an HS2 hub, connecting Birmingham and Leeds, and servicing the cities of Nottingham and Derby, caught the eye as it was one of the few communities on the route that was not a major city. Since then, it has been the focus of proposals for huge investment and development. But the   means it is not clear how much of this will go ahead. ""We're in limbo and it isn't good for anyone,"" said Graham Heal, 67, speaking to the BBC on a muddy path through trees that could one day lead to the rail hub. He has lived in Toton for 10 years and believes the project will make a ""massive"" change to the area, nearly doubling it in size and attracting a younger demographic. ""We've got about 6,000 houses in Toton at the moment and they're planning another 4,000,"" he said.  ""Of course there are people who don't want to see this huge shake-up and they want to know for certain if they need to move out quickly and let other people move in. ""Let's get it sorted out now, one way or the other."" Richard Hutchinson, 48, who chairs the area's neighbourhood forum, said HS2 would mean Toton would see ""development like it's never seen before"", but ""nothing has changed"" since it was first announced. ""There's been pockets of development,"" he added. ""But nothing on the scale we're talking about over the next 20 to 30 years if HS2 and the rest of the development comes to the area. ""It's frustrating to a lot of people - stakeholders, us, the community - they can't move forwards, they don't understand what's going to happen. ""People want to be communicated to, they want to understand the plans so they can plan their lives around it. ""Let's stop discussing and let's get a decision and allow people to get moving."" Mark Shelton, 25, who was born and raised in Toton, has just bought a house in nearby Long Eaton. He said: ""There was a lot of discussion about HS2. ""I was going to put an offer in on one but then they said it might be backing on to the garden and I had to think 'Will I be able to sell it for the same price in the future? Will it drop or increase in value?' ""I bought a different one a bit further away for that reason. ""You've got to be careful. I think a lot of people are in the same situation, thinking about whether they want to move here, is it going to get too busy?"" Kun Darnley, 42, who lives in nearby Chilwell, said she was looking to buy in Toton but wanted to know where exactly the train tracks will go before doing so. She said: ""People who are looking to buy property round here, who have a family, there's concern about safety. ""I'm worried about the train tracks. I'd like to know where exactly they're going to build it and how they're going to keep kids safe."" Jonathan Grey, who has lived in Toton for 20 years, said the development will have a ""dramatic"" impact on the town. He said: ""I don't know why it's taking so long but I presume the wheels of government churn on quite slowly. ""There's not much more we can do as a community in preparation, but when they announce if it's definitely going to happen then we can assess the full impact."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it remained ""committed"" to enabling the East Midlands to ""reap the benefits of high-speed rail services"". He added: ""The Integrated Rail Plan will soon outline exactly how major rail projects, including HS2 phase 2b and other transformational projects such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, will work together to deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the north and midlands need and deserve."" Until then, residents will just have to wait to find out the fate of their town.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58909524,2021-10-15,2
25,"HS2: What is the route, when will it be finished and what will it cost?","The announcement is part of the government's £96bn rail programme - although only about half is new investment. HS2 is a massive project intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. It will cost tens of billions of pounds and is aimed at cutting journey times and increasing capacity.  It's hoped HS2 will create jobs and grow the UK economy outside London. But HS2 has faced delays and mounting concerns over the exact route and spiralling costs. HS2 was originally meant to connect   with  ,   and  . Work has already started on the first phase, linking London and the West Midlands.  The next section will extend the line to Crewe. The final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. But the Leeds leg is being scrapped. This had been billed as reducing the journey time from London to Leeds by 50 minutes. Under the government's  : Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the measures will mean faster journeys up to 10 years earlier than planned. But opponents said he was watering down previous plans. The decision not to go ahead with the eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds goes back on previous government pledges. In May,   - and would be delivered earlier than planned.  ""We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,"" he said. He suggested the eastern leg could be brought forward ""quite dramatically"" by building it ""in a smarter way"". The government says HS2 will cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, down to 52 minutes.  Once the second phase is complete, HS2 would also take an hour off journeys from Manchester to London. The plan for the eastern leg was to join HS2 to the existing East Coast Main Line, leading to significantly faster journey times. For example, travelling from London to Leeds currently takes two hours and 13 minutes. Under the HS2 plans it would have taken one hour and 21 minutes. The latest proposals mean it will take one hour and 53 minutes. Campaigners against HS2, including those living on the proposed route, have welcomed the news. Others are not happy. Labour's Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said Mr Johnson had ""repeatedly promised"" the new high-speed Leeds-Manchester line would be ""built in full"", adding: ""Leeds and the North have been betrayed"". The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, representing councils and businesses, said not including Bradford in the east-west upgrade would be ""disastrous"" in economic terms. The London and Birmingham leg was due to open at the end of 2026. But   between 2029 and 2033. The second phase was due to open in 2032-33, but has been pushed back to 2035-2040. The current estimated cost of HS2 is between £72bn and £98bn (at 2019 prices), compared with an original budget of £55.7bn in 2015 (at 2015 prices).  But this was made before the decision was taken to cancel the Leeds leg. Management issues and unrealistic land valuations caused costs to spiral.   Former executive Doug Thornton previously told BBC Panorama initial estimates for buying property and land were "" "". A 2019 Freedom of Information request revealed that property costs are forecast to reach £5bn, compared to the original £1.1bn estimate. HS2 also failed to carry out extensive soil surveys, causing problems for digging and excavation, according to the project's former chairman, Allan Cook. HS2 has faced a lot of opposition - much of it to do with the environmental impact. Pressure group Stop HS2 believes it will increase carbon emissions and damage areas of natural beauty. Protesters, including  , have built tunnels in an attempt disrupt HS2 construction.

26,HS2 downgrade met with mixed reaction in East Midlands,"The government's new Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) states the Birmingham to Leeds route will now terminate at East Midlands Parkway, in Nottinghamshire. It also plans to electrify the existing Midlands Mainline and invest about £11bn in rail links in the region. While some were relieved at the decision, others were disappointed. Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield and the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, described the proposals to link the East and West Midlands through Leicestershire as ""fantastic"". ""The biggest thing for us in Nottinghamshire is our economic development and jobs creation,"" he said. ""Off the back of this, we are linking disadvantaged communities into huge sites for jobs."" However, Lilian Greenwood, Labour MP for Nottingham South, accused the government of selling the region short and branded the axing of the eastern leg a ""rail betrayal"". She said: ""The [plan] is a huge betrayal of our region and, by spinning this as a good deal, Ben Bradley is simply selling our county and our region short. ""We'll lose out on massively improved connections to Leeds, the North East and Scotland. ""By scrapping the full eastern leg, we won't get the extra capacity needed to create more local rail services and get more freight on rail - and lorries off our roads."" I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2 is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. Alex Norris, Labour MP for Nottingham North, added: ""This U-turn will be a blow to our regional and local economies."" Original proposals for the route suggested it would run through communities on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border to a major hub at Toton, connecting the cities of Nottingham and Derby. Under the new plans, the Midlands Mainline will be electrified as far as Sheffield -   - and Toton will become a mainline station. This will connect to the reopened Maid Marian Line - closed during the 1960s Beeching Cuts - to provide passenger connectivity with places like Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Selston and Pinxton. It comes alongside a commitment to extending the Robin Hood Line out to Edwinstowe and Ollerton.  suggests this is a project long campaigned for by politicians including the Government's chief whip and Sherwood MP Mark Spencer. This would connect with the Maid Marian Line in Ashfield to reach the Toton station, and eventually on to HS2 via the light rail connection. Jason Zadrozny, the independent leader of Ashfield District Council, welcomed the Maid Marian Line news but criticised the overall HS2 plans. ""We've always said reopening the Maid Marian Line to passengers was a no-brainer,"" he said. ""With regards to HS2 - it's been the worst kept secret in Nottinghamshire for years that HS2 would not stop at Toton. ""[The government] talks about levelling up, yet this looks like it will further exacerbate issues in Nottinghamshire and put us further behind the rest of the UK."" However Midlands Connect - the government-funded regional transport group - said there were positives in the plans. Chair Sir John Peace said: ""Today's announcement gives businesses and local leaders the reassurance they've been waiting for - that HS2 is coming to the East Midlands. ""Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of... things to be excited about - a new high speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway [and] direct links on to HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield."" He added the delivery of a new station at Toton could start, which would help kickstart regeneration in that area. ""The plans around Toton, the adjacent freeport and the wider Development Corporation could create 84,000 jobs and add billions in value to the regional economy; the developments cover the size of three Olympic Parks,"" he said. He added an upgrade of an East Coast Mainline junction at Newark - also mentioned in the plan - would allow better connectivity with Nottingham, Lincoln and other regional hubs. Residents in the towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme, said they were relieved about its axing. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he said. However, he criticised the amount of time the decision had taken. ""People's lives have been totally put on hold for a long time because nobody is saying what is going to happen,"" he said. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, would have seen her home demolished. ""I'm quite happy to be staying here,"" she said. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" Sim Harris, editor of Rail News, said the proposals for the eastern leg of HS2 had always had problems. ""The idea of running the line to the east of Derby and the west of Nottingham meant neither city got a high speed station,"" he said. ""Putting it at Toton was an unfortunate compromise. By the time residents had travelled there, they could have been on their way to London on a regular train."" He viewed the location of East Midlands Parkway as a better choice. ""It will prove a useful east-west corridor and could mean a faster service between Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-59319898,2021-11-18,2
27,HS2 rail plan scrapping attacked by North East leaders,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced   promised to bring faster journeys. The planned Northern Powerhouse Rail line has been replaced with an upgrade and electrification which will extend to the Tees Valley and Newcastle.  Anti-HS2 campaigners welcomed the news but Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon described it as ""a hammer blow"".  Mr Gannon, who is chair of the North East Joint Transport Committee, called the government's long-awaited Integrated Rail Plan ""the very opposite of levelling up"". Mr Gannon, a Labour politician, added: ""I'm not quite sure what our area has done to deserve such contempt.  ""The government appears to be arbitrarily ruling out major investment in the East Coast Main Line in our region, as well as confirming it won't build HS2 to Yorkshire or the North East, and the Northern Powerhouse Rail plan seems to have been scaled back to a minor upgrade that is pretty much what was already promised - and not delivered - a decade ago.""  Given HS2 was never going to pass through the North East, you might wonder why some politicians and business leaders in the region feel let down. One reason is capacity. The East Coast Main Line is creaking. A new high-speed eastern link to London would have eased the pressure.  The government insists its plans include enough investment on existing lines to keep services on the rails and offer shorter journey times, but their opponents are deeply sceptical.  The second reason is symbolism. There is a clear contrast between the billions upon billions invested in new rail lines in London, and the HS2 Birmingham link, with what Labour has called a ""make do and mend"" approach in the North. It's possible ministers are calculating the North East public will be less anguished than politicians and business leaders about a high-speed line that didn't pass through the region.  They could be right. But in order to answer charges that their plan levels down rather than up, voters who backed the Conservatives in 2019 will surely want evidence that buses and trains they use every day will be backed instead. There is the plan to put passenger trains back on the Northumberland Line between Ashington and Tyneside, but today's blueprint offered little or no hope for the reopening of the Leamside Line. That is a route that could be a boon to commuters in Wearside and County Durham, especially those living in Washington - currently the largest town in England without a rail service. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Commons earlier the plans would mean journey times being slashed across the region with what he claimed was an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"". He said the overhaul would bring faster journeys up to 10 years earlier than planned. However, Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said it was a ""false economy"". ""This is a short-sighted decision that will worsen UK regional inequality,"" he said. ""Today's announcement is a false economy, not a strategic plan, saving a relatively small amount of money while causing years of disruption for commuters by attempting to improve existing infrastructure that was first built in the Victorian era."" The regional branch of the CBI said businesses were disappointed the ""goalposts have moved at the 11th hour"". CBI North East director Sarah Glendinning said the plan was a ""significant investment that will go some way towards modernising our ageing rail networks and can be delivered at pace"". However, she added businesses were ""concerned that some of the areas most sorely in need of development will lose out as a result of the scaled-back plans"". Newcastle North Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said people would ""struggle to understand why this government expects northerners to be grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking 20th Century rail system"". ""We have waited so long for this Integrated Rail Plan, but rather than the blueprint for integrating Northern Powerhouse Rail and HS2 that was promised, all we seem left with is a collection of smaller-scale projects that amount to a continuation of disintegrated rail,"" she said. Stockton North Labour MP Alex Cunningham called the decision an ""utter betrayal of the people in Teesside and the North East by the government"". Meanwhile Middlesbrough Labour MP Andy McDonald accused the government of short-changing the North East and said the ""make do and mend"" approach was ""not good enough"". Mr McDonald said: ""For too long the North East has been forgotten and rail commuters have faced a poor service on inadequate infrastructure and major investment is needed across our regional network. ""It's a different world compared with the South East. ""If HS2 is to lift the strain off our entire rail network and deliver the full benefits for passengers and communities across all of the North of England and the Midlands, all of it needs to be built not just part.""   Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: ""HS2 will deliver nothing for Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool.  ""The whole project is a waste of money and should be scrapped in order to focus on improving regional rail travel.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-59332867,2021-11-18,2

After 28 days underground, he said ""we can stop it with this tactic"" and halt the multi-billion pound scheme. HS2 Ltd urged ""anyone who cares about the environment to support [its] project"". The rail line is due to run between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds and   from London to Birmingham. The  the entire project is between £72bn and £98bn. Swampy was among protesters who had charges against them dropped recently after they  . He had joined protesters digging a tunnel at the WAR camp in Buckinghamshire - between the A413 and the local Chiltern railway line south of Wendover - where eviction began five weeks ago. The activist told the BBC: ""If we look back to the 90s, we stopped the road-building programme [using] tactics like tunnelling, in fact that probably was the [thing] that broke the camel's back. ""So we can stop it with this tactic which will save the country billions of pounds... they just have to reverse it.  ""It's hugely unpopular with deforestation on a massive scale. ""This project is pumping millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere so this is a greenwash and it needs to be stopped."" HS2 Ltd, which was set up by the government to build the line, has said it will be one of the most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects ever delivered in the UK. A spokeswoman said: ""By providing a cleaner, greener way to travel, HS2 will help cut the number of cars and lorries on our roads, cut demand for domestic flights, and help the country's push to reduce carbon emissions. ""Instead of wasting their time and public money on often violent and disruptive protest, we would urge anyone who cares about the environment to support this project."" Swampy said he ""hopes more tunnels will happen on the route"" and has not yet ruled out taking part in future protests.

30,HS2: Campaigners 'elated' after high-speed rail link scrapped,"The £40bn section was set to cut through parts of South and West Yorkshire to link the Midlands and Leeds. Opponents said they were relieved to learn that the government was expected to ditch the planned route. Instead, new plans said to cost £96bn are expected in place of High Speed 2. Under the original proposal, homes would have been demolished and large viaducts built to accommodate the proposed Birmingham to Leeds route and spur line to Sheffield. It was hoped the new lines would decrease journey times and expand capacity on the rail network. Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said the route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line, bringing with it ""no benefits"". According to the latest plans, the high-speed line would cut through the east side of the village as it followed the M18 motorway, creating noise and disruption during building, she said. ""We're absolutely elated that it's not going to go ahead, if the reports are true,"" she said, holding back tears. ""I can't begin to tell you... it's the elation coming out now. So much hard work has gone on to stop this. ""For five and a half years, nobody has listened, and finally, if this is cancelled, it proves that what we've been trying to say all these years is true,"" she said. The eastern route was expected to start construction in 2033 and was set to cut journey times to London. The Department for Transport said both phases of the project, costing between £72bn and £98bn, would slash travel time between Leeds and London to 1 hour and 21 minutes, while it would take 1 hour and 27 minutes from Sheffield to the capital. The first leg of the route, between London and Birmingham, is due to open between 2029 and 2033. In Aston, near Rotherham, fellow campaigner Jenny Shimwell said she was ""relieved but angry"" at the prospect of the route being scrapped.  She said residents have had years of worry with the line planned to cut through their village and an equestrian centre. ""We have all the disruption, all the links cut while they construct the thing, and [HS2] could not answer our questions,"" she said. Now, she hopes money will be spent on rail links that will better connect northern towns and cities. ""What I'm hoping is the Northern Rail Plan is something that will link up the communities because that's what we need,"" she said. ""Something we would like, not something that they would like to give us."" In West Yorkshire, Campaigner and chair of Crofton Against HS2, Jonathan Pile is worried about a ""sting in the tail"" from new rail plans affecting the West Yorkshire village.  this weekend, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce two shorter high-speed routes created in part by upgrading existing lines. One will run between Leeds and Sheffield cutting journey times from 42 to 24 minutes, but it is not confirmed if Crofton will be directly affected. ""The more we understand, the more angry we are,"" Mr Pile said. He believes part of the route will still cut through the village. ""What they're proposing is firing a 250mph bullet train out of Leeds and through our community and it's then going to travel about 25 miles in five minutes and come to a screeching halt as it goes around a big bend and chugs its way to Sheffield. ""We're delighted the eastern leg has fallen through and we're not surprised, but this decision makes less sense.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-59303941,2021-11-16,2

The discoveries at the old St Mary's Church in Stoke Mandeville have been sent for specialist analysis. Dr Rachel Wood, lead archaeologist for HS2 contractor Fusion JV, said they were ""really rare finds in the UK"". ""To find one stone head or one set of shoulders would be really astonishing, but we have two complete heads and shoulders as well as a third head as well,"" said Dr Wood. ""They're even more significant to us archaeologically, because they've actually helped change our understanding of the site here before the medieval church was built."" A hexagonal glass Roman jug was also uncovered with large pieces still intact, despite being in the ground for what is thought to be more than 1,000 years. Dr Wood added: ""They are so significant and so remarkable that we would certainly hope that they will end up on display for the local community to see."" Archaeologists have been working on the site and about 3,000 bodies have been removed from the church, which dates back to 1080, and will be reburied elsewhere. Since work began in 2018, the well-preserved walls and structural features of the church have been revealed, along with unusual stone carvings and medieval graffiti including markings believed to be sun dials or witching marks.

35,HS2: Storm helps reveal 'once-in-a-lifetime' coins find,"The hoard of 300 potins, which are an early version of a coin, were found in Hillingdon, following a storm which helped reveal their position. Archaeologists have dated them to the 1st century BC, at a time when the Romans were beginning to establish themselves in Britain. The discovery has been described as a ""once-in-a-lifetime find"". Each of the potins are about 3cm (1.2 in) in diameter and are based on coins struck in Marseille, France, about 2,175 years ago. On one side they show a stylised image of the head of Greek god Apollo, while a charging bull is on the other. Emma Tetlow, historic environment lead for HS2's main contractors Skanska, Costain and Strabag, explained how her team had been ""coming to the end of our archaeological work... when we found a patch of soil that was a very different colour"" following a storm which had altered the ground conditions. ""The patch of soil was dark greeny-blue, which suggests oxidised metal, and when we checked more closely, we could see loosely packed metal discs."" She described the discovery as ""a once-in-a-lifetime find"". The potins, which have been named the ""Hillingdon Hoard"", were taken to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery to be cleaned and preserved so specialists to investigate them further. Coins were not thought to have been used for the exchange of goods and service at the time and archaeologists believe the hoard may have been used to mark the boundary of a property or was an offering to the gods. Hoards are also thought to have been buried in isolated locations as emergency savings for times of crisis. Potins like these from the late Iron Age like have been found previously but in much smaller quantities meaning this find is considered very significant. The value of the hoard has yet to be determined and a coroner is to decide whether they can be considered ""treasure"", meaning they can be acquired by a museum.

Campaigners said they wanted to ""fight for the woodland"" in Buckinghamshire. A spokesman for the high-speed rail line said 4.1 hectares (10 acres) of new woodland would be created nearby. The three have been charged with obstructing a public highway, while a fourth was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence dating to last month, and released under investigation. The estimated final cost of the HS2 project is now more than £100bn. , and classics like Fantastic Mr Fox are said to have taken inspiration from the beech wood. Its felling had been delayed since last year after bats were discovered roosting at the site, which is in the  .

She said: ""I'm here in physical form because the legal system is not designed to protect the environment.

40,Euston anti-HS2 tunnel protest: Dr Larch Maxey denies trespassing,"Dr Larch Maxey was removed by bailiffs on Monday after going underground on 26 January to protest against the high-speed railway line. He appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court and is also accused of criminal damage and obstructing bailiffs in his eviction. The 48-year-old denied all charges. Dr Maxey became the fifth campaigner to leave the tunnels, after a 16-year-old boy did so last Wednesday, having spent 22 days underground. Lazer Sandford, 20, Scott Breen, 46, and a 17-year-old female protester have also ended their protest.  Dan Hooper, known as Swampy, Isla Sandford, known as Blue, and two other protesters referred to in court papers as Nemo and Bradley remain in the tunnels. The court heard Dr Maxey, of Denham, Buckinghamshire, is accused of trespassing and disrupting HS2 construction work at Euston Square Gardens by refusing to leave a tunnel under the site between 27 January and 22 February. He is also alleged to have damaged a mobile phone, belonging to Vision Limited, at the site between 17 February and 19 February. Dr Maxey is further accused of trespassing on a separate HS2 site on Hampstead Road between 6 October and 11 October last year and disrupting work by climbing a tree and refusing to come down. He was granted bail on the condition he does not interfere with the workings at any HS2 construction site and observes a curfew at an address in south London between 23:00 GMT and 07:00. A crowd of supporters standing outside the court cheered as he exited the building shortly after his hearing. He is next due to appear on 14 July for trial.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-56168446,2021-02-23,2
41,HS2: Charges against '7 Sisters' tree protest in Buckinghamshire dropped,"The group, who dubbed themselves the ""7 Sisters"", were accused of stopping work in June 2020 at Poor's Piece in Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire. The tree was later felled on 23 September last year to make way for the HS2 high speed rail route. A judge said the prosecution had failed to provide evidence after almost a year and dismissed all charges against them. The protesters had claimed the 200-year-old oak tree was home to species including bats and red kites. The women were accused of aggravated trespass at Poor's Piece on 3 June 2020. The defendants were Miriam Instone, 22, from Bury, Imogen May, 48, from Devon, Morgana Donfrancesco, 29, from Bristol, together with Michelle MacDonagh, 33, Mina Jaf, 23, Jessica Walker, 29, and Samantha Smithson, 38, whose addresses were not disclosed. All seven denied aggravated trespass and a second charge of hiding or obstructing tools on a property under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. The prosecution's request for an adjournment on Monday was refused by District Judge Malcolm Dodds at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court. ""On July 28 last year I made clear directions for disclosure on all evidence the prosecution rely on by 25th August. Here we are nearly a year later,"" the judge said. Judge Dodds said a trial had been expected to begin in January this year but was postponed because of Covid regulations. However, he said the evidence had been expected to be in place. ""I now hear an expert report that was supposed to be filed on 8 February was only filed today. I have four advocates all saying we did not get it,"" he said. ""All disclosure should have been in good time for trial in January this year.""

42,HS2: Calls for project to be classed as 'England-only',"They said the UK government's own analysis concluded the rail project would produce ""an economic dis-benefit to Wales"". The Welsh government called the classification of HS2 as an England and Wales project ""unfair and biased"".  The UK government said it had committed £1.5bn to Welsh railways.  HS2 is a high-speed rail line planned to link London with Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds.  The multi-billion pound project, which could see  , has been controversial after estimates that the  .  The MPs want HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project despite rail infrastructure not being devolved in Wales beyond the core valleys lines. The Welsh government receives a proportional top-up to the budget when new spending is announced for devolved areas in England which will not apply to Wales, through what is known as ""Barnett consequentials"". The report says while the Welsh government received ""approximately £755m in Barnett consequentials"" between 2015 and 2019 as a result of the Department for Transport spending money on HS2, it will not receive a proportionate amount because it has been classified by the Treasury as an ""England and Wales project"". This has attracted criticism from the MPs because the rail line will run solely in England.  The Welsh Affairs Committee said: ""It is a project of unprecedented size and complexity and has already created several thousand jobs as part of a supply chain that spans the country, including Wales.""  But it said Wales would ""not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials arising from the HS2 project. This is despite the fact that UK government's own analysis has concluded that HS2 will produce an economic dis-benefit for Wales"".  It said HS2 could ""yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancements to the North Wales mainline, including upgrades at Chester and Crewe stations which will be required for full electrification of the North Wales mainline to proceed"". The report also calls for a new Wales Rail Board of Welsh and UK government bodies to identify areas where Welsh railways could be improved and invested in.  The MPs also have called on the UK government to bring forward proposals for greater connectivity between Swansea, Cardiff and Bristol by the end of 2021, calling the decision to cancel the electrification of the Cardiff-Swansea mainline ""short-sighted and regrettable"". The group, chaired by Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, said if clear benefits for passengers and freight users could be delivered by transferring powers over rail infrastructure from the UK government to the Welsh government then ""the case for further devolution would be compelling"".  But they said ""few benefits to rail users have been identified"" and the benefits of ""existing management arrangements are considerable"". The Welsh government welcomed the calls to ""address unfair and biased categorisation of HS2 as an England and Wales project, which continues to disadvantage rail investment in Wales"".  A spokesman said their ""long term objective remains full devolution of the rail network and a fair funding settlement for rail infrastructure in Wales"".  But they said ""irrespective of where responsibility rests in the short term"" they supported ""close strategic collaboration"" to ""meet passenger needs"" and ""support our decarbonisation commitments"". A spokesperson for the UK government's Department for Transport said: ""We have already committed  a record £1.5bn to the Welsh railways in recent years and the recently announced Union Connectivity Review will look at how best to enhance transport links across the United Kingdom to improve connectivity.""  The UK government has argued HS2 will boost reliability, connectivity and capacity on routes across the UK, including services into Wales.

43,HS2 underground protest: Activists 'being forced out' of tunnel,"HS2 Rebellion, who are  , say the team is burrowing a vertical tunnel causing crumbs of earth to fall around them.  The activists dug tunnels to thwart their eviction from a protest camp. HS2 declined to comment but has previously said all activities to protect the protesters would be safe. The protesters, who said the eviction team was also digging above their heads, have refused to say how many people are underground but say they are confident they can last several more days.  Some of the group who were outside the tunnels have been arrested. One protester said: ""All night we've had rocks falling down on to our head through the gaps.  ""They've kept us awake all night for hours and hours and hours to keep us awake and try and coax us out of the hole.  ""All of the dirt is still coming down in my sleeves. It's not the most pleasant of experiences, it's pretty nasty to be fair."" In September, the group set up a Tree Protection Camp in the gardens in protest against the £106bn HS2 scheme.  The campaigners allege that the small green space near Euston station will be built over with a temporary taxi rank, before being sold to developers, as part of plans for the high-speed railway.  The eviction team has now removed the roof from the structure which protected the front of the tunnel. Meanwhile, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have urged the government to reconsider the HS2 project, saying the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed the economic case for the high-speed rail line. The railway was signed off by Prime Minister Boris Johnson almost a year ago before travel plummeted as a result of the virus and people turned to home working and Zoom. The protesters say the project will prove a waste of money. A government spokesman said HS2 would continue because and form a vital part of the UK's future infrastructure. Most people think of trains as being cleaner than cars and that's generally true. But in the case of HS2, there's a new track to be carved through the countryside and that has changed the equation. That's because of the vast quantities of carbon emitted during the construction of the line, with all its steel, and cement, and its huge construction machines. HS2 first estimated it would take more than 100 years to repay this ""carbon debt"" before the line started to save CO2 - that's way beyond what UK climate targets demand.  The firm has now withdrawn that calculation, but not offered another figure. And now there's another factor at play: the seismic shift in travel patterns following the coronavirus pandemic and the Zoom revolution. HS2 was designed to serve increased passenger numbers. Protesters say there's such uncertainty about future travel that building the line now looks a £100bn gamble. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55877829,2021-01-31,2
44,HS2 protesters dig tunnel to thwart Euston eviction,"In September, members of HS2 Rebellion set up a Tree Protection Camp in Euston Square Gardens in central London to protest against the £106bn scheme. They claim the tunnel is 100ft (30m) long and has taken two months to dig. Activists say the tunnel - codenamed ""Kelvin"" - is their ""best defence"" against being evicted. One protester, identified only as Blue, told the BBC: ""It is all very dangerous and life-threatening but it is all worth it. This is the only way I can effect change, I would sacrifice everything for the climate ecological emergency to not be happening."" The 18-year-old added: ""We want to be as safe as possible. It is not about us martyring ourselves, it is about delaying and stopping HS2."" A spokeswoman for HS2 said tunnel protests were ""costly to the taxpayer"". She added: ""These are a danger to the safety of the protesters, HS2 staff, High Court enforcement officers and the general public, as well as putting unnecessary strain on the emergency services during the pandemic.  ""Safety is our first priority when taking possession of land and removing illegal encampments."" British Transport Police said it was aware of the tunnel but it was a matter for the Met Police, which said no complaint yet had been made. HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce rail passenger overcrowding and help to rebalance the UK's economy. The campaign group alleges HS2 is the ""most expensive, wasteful and destructive project in UK history"" and that it is ""set to destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites"". However, HS2 bosses have said seven million trees will be planted during phase one of the project and that much ancient woodland will ""remain intact"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September that the first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham  . The second phase, to Manchester and Leeds, was due to open in 2032-33 but that has been pushed back to 2035-40. Network Rail, which owns the land, has been approached for a comment about the tunnel. Tunnelling as a form of environmental protest has a long history in the UK.  In the 1990s it was one of the ways that pushed environmental concerns into the headlines and changed perceptions. In one of the environmental protesters'  , written by ""Disco Dave"", it says:  ""In the world of NVDA (non-violent direct action) there are few defence tactics that can compare with the protest tunnel. Dangerous, laborious and time consuming, tunnelling is the ultimate and desperate tactic of desperate people in desperate times."" The first protest tunnel goes back to the M11 and 1993 but they only really developed during the  .  Protest tunnels against the A30 in Devon and Manchester Airport's second runway then followed. Not only did they make household names of environmental campaigners like ""Swampy"" but they arguably changed transport policy - road-building reduced massively.  We have seen tunnels more recently in   in a protest against fracking so it's not a massive surprise we are seeing tunnels again. Tunnelling in particular as a direct action slows down developers and it is expensive to dig out protesters safely. Disco Dave wrote: ""That ultimately is the purpose of tunnels and tree houses. To act as a deterrent warning the authorities that should they decide to evict, then it will hurt them where for them it hurts most - in the pocket."" What will be interesting is if these tunnels have the same impact on HS2 as they did on the road-building programme of the late 1990s. Will it reframe HS2 so it will be seen in the same way as fracking or road building? Or can the argument still be made that it is a low-carbon form of travel even though it does cause some destruction of habitat?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55796445,2021-01-26,2
45,HS2: Old Oak Common construction work begins,"Construction of a 1.1-mile-long (1.8km) underground wall at Old Oak Common started after Grant Shapps gave the signal for digging to begin. The site will become the UK's largest railway station built in a single stage with a total of six HS2 platforms. HS2 said the station would be ""pivotal"" for rail travel in the South East. Preparatory work had already taken place at the 32-acre site but it was the first time permanent construction work had been started. The underground wall will form part of the shell around the HS2 platforms. When completed the ""super hub"" station will feature a roof covering the area of more than three football pitches and will serve Crossrail and mainline trains in addition to HS2 services. The creation of HS2 has proved controversial, with the project proving to be a major issue in last week's shock  Asked whether there was enough public support for HS2, Mr Shapps replied that the Victorians had built the West Coast and East Coast mainlines and ""we've carried on using them to this day"". ""I've no doubt at all that over the decades and centuries that follow, we'll be pleased that this generation did something for the future,"" he said.

The BBC asked the   (listed in alphabetical order by surname) what they would do if elected. Carolyne Culver is the   group leader on West Berkshire Council and she has already campaigned to try to save Jones' Hill Wood and the Leather Lane oak trees near Great Missenden, which are being cleared for the project. ""Any candidate who tells you it's too late to stop HS2, isn't made of strong enough stuff to be your MP,"" she said. ""If elected, I would demand that people who have lost homes and land because of HS2 are compensated immediately. ""I would demand the lifting of gagging orders, which prevent residents, councils and even the Health and Safety Executive from speaking out. ""HS2 mitigation is a nonsense.

""In recent days, HS2 has been forced to disclose documents that prove our water supply and rivers are at risk from tunnelling. This project has to end.""     An   said non-disclosure agreements were only held with organisations in order to protect commercially-sensitive information, protect property from potential blight, or the personal information of those who may be affected by changes to HS2's design. He added that the documents referred to ""actually demonstrate HS2 Ltd is doing a considerable amount of work to account for all potential impacts of construction and taking every possible precaution.

Former Conservative MEP and diplomat, Brendan Donnelly, who lives in London, is standing for   and runs an educational charity. He said that while he was ""not speaking on behalf of the Rejoin EU party"", personally he thought the HS2 project was ""financially and environmentally suspect"".

""It's probably impossible now to prevent the project going ahead, but I would certainly support any initiative to lessen its damaging financial and environmental consequences.

""There are genuine fears that tunnelling could damage the chalk streams, which provide drinking water to thousands of local people.

51,"Stoke Mandeville: HS2 to move 3,000 bodies from medieval churchyard","Archaeologists are working on the site of the old St Mary's Church in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, which dates back to 1080. The remains will be reburied at a new site with a specially created monument. Helen Wass, head of heritage for HS2 Ltd, said the work would ""shine a light on what life was like"" in the area. The old church, built shortly after the Norman conquest of England, fell into disrepair after a new church was built in the 1880s. According to local accounts, a child was killed by falling masonry in the 1930s, and by 1966 the Royal Engineers were drafted in to demolish the building. The remaining rubble has since become overgrown with vegetation. The church burial ground was in use for 900 years with the last recorded interment in 1908. The old church's position on the route of HS2 means it is being removed by works contractor Fusion-JV and a team from from LP-Archaeology. Since work began in 2018 the well-preserved walls and structural features of the church have been revealed, along with unusual stone carvings and medieval graffiti including markings believed to be sun dials or witching marks. This year work started on the final phase of excavations, with a large tent constructed over the site. Over the next six months, a team of 40 archaeologists will remove the remaining church structure and excavate around 3,000 people buried in the churchyard. A final decision on where artefacts or the remains of the church itself will go has not yet been made. Ms Wass said the work was ""an exceptional opportunity for archaeologists to uncover and shine a light on what life was like for the community of Stoke Mandeville over such a timespan"". She said any discoveries would be shared via open days and lectures. Rachel Wood, a project archaeologist for Fusion JV, said: ""Those buried there will be remembered once again and the lives they lived over 900 years understood.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-56981338,2021-05-05,2
52,Chris Packham loses bid for legal challenge over HS2,"He had argued there were failings in the way the government decided to give the project the go-ahead. In April, the Springwatch presenter was refused permission by judges in the High Court for a full judicial review of the decision.  Mr Packham said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the ruling. In giving the decision, Lord Justice Lindblom said the court ""rejected both of Mr Packham's substantive grounds of appeal as unarguable"". The judgment noted his claims included that the government misunderstood local environmental concerns and had failed to examine the environmental effects of HS2. The TV presenter had alleged the government had not accounted for the effect on greenhouse gas emissions up to 2050 in light of ""obligations under the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act 2008"". At a July hearing, lawyers for Mr Packham said a review gave an ""incomplete assessment of environmental matters"" which meant the government approved HS2 with a ""complete misapprehension"" of its environmental impact. In written submissions, David Wolfe QC argued ministers would have proceeded with their decision on the basis the Oakervee Review (a government-commissioned report set up to examine whether and how HS2 should proceed) would have explained what they needed to know, when it did not. But Timothy Mould QC, acting for the government, said: ""It is simply fanciful for the appellant to assume that the first respondent (the Secretary of State for Transport) knew nothing about the public legislative and procedural history of HS2, including the comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts undertaken in accordance with parliamentary procedures, beyond that which was drawn to his attention by the report itself."" In his statement, Mr Packham said: ""The fact is, we are a world away from the place we were when we issued the original claim for judicial review. He said Covid-19 had turned the country's finances and the public's attitudes towards climate change ""upside down"". ""People now see that a scheme for a railway which will tear up the countryside so that we can shave a few minutes off a journey time, makes no sense in the contemporary workplace,"" he stated. HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said it took its ""commitment to the environment extremely seriously"" and there was ""safeguarding in place to protect wildlife and other natural assets"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said the project was ""crucial to rebuilding our economy from coronavirus"" and HS2 had been tasked with ""delivering one of the UK's most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-53616109,2020-07-31,2
53,Campaigner 'scaled machinery' to protect HS2 woods,"The transport secretary and HS2 Ltd allege Elliott Cuciurean, 22, breached an injunction 17 times in Crackley Woods, Warwickshire, this year. Together they have brought a case at Birmingham High Court to have Mr Cuciurean, from Cheltenham, jailed. The campaigner claims there was ""confusion"" about what land was covered by the court order. Video footage shown to high court judges showed Mr Cuciurean, also known as Jelly Tot, on top of the tree lopper and, in a separate incident, being removed from a tree via the use of a cherry picker. He was described as ""a very active protester"" and told the court he scaled the machinery because it ""is going to continue cutting down trees so I will do what I can to stop it'."" He said he arrived at the protest camp which neighbours the work site on 4 April and would walk the perimeter ""to keep an eye on things"". HS2 Ltd claim Mr Cuciurean breached an injunction on an area of land within an 8km (4.9-mile) perimeter at the Crackley Woods construction site. The activist told the high court he did not see injunction warning notices in the area and was never informed of the detail of the enforcement. However he admitted he had moved fences around the site and was there ""to stop the work"". High court enforcement officer Gary Bovan, who had been at the woods throughout April, said it was ""very important"" to know Mr Cuciurean' location on the site because ""he'll go and find out all of the site, work out weak places and hotspots"". Judgement is expected to be reserved until a later date.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-53596957,2020-07-31,2
54,Anti-HS2 campaigners begin week-long protest,"Demonstrators from Extinction Rebellion and the Stop HS2 group set out from Birmingham's Curzon Street Station to London at 09:00 BST. They accuse HS2 of ""decimating countryside and creating a huge financial burden at a time of deep economic crisis"". HS2 said the ""majority of [the groups'] accusations are inaccurate"". About 100 people gathered outside the station, which will be the high-speed rail line's terminus when it opens in Birmingham - expected to be between 2028-2031. ""We're marching because we've had enough,"" Matthew Bishop, from the Save Cubbington Woods campaign, said. ""That the government has carried on with HS2 when we urgently need funding for our health service, our economic recovery and our local transport networks, makes clear where their priorities lie."" Originally expected to cost £56bn, the latest estimate shows costs of the project have spiralled to £106bn. In May,   and accused HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence. Protesters are demanding funds are used for the country's economic recovery following the coronavirus lockdown instead. They are walking the 125-mile (201 km) route that phase one of the rail line will take. The group plans to walk 18.6 miles (30km) a day, through Warwickshire and the Chilterns, until they reach London Euston. A spokesperson from HS2 said the organisation ""is already playing a pivotal role in helping Britain's economic recovery"", through jobs and contract opportunities.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-53119960,2020-06-20,2
55,HS2: RSPB calls for probe into tree-felling for high-speed line,"The bird charity   government and HS2 as ecologists launched a legal challenge against   to permit the felling of trees in Jones' Hill Wood in Buckinghamshire. It said the felling risked ""undermining every environmental commitment"" the government had made about HS2. HS2 said it took its ""environmental responsibilities seriously"".  The legal action is being brought by a member of  .  On Monday, the High Court was asked to consider a hearing for a judicial review of the licensing decision. The plaintiff also requested the court put a block on licensing activities, such as site clearance, until the hearing had taken place and a judgement was handed down. Felling was delayed from last year after bats were discovered roosting at the site which is part of the  , and was reportedly the inspiration for local author Roald Dahl's story Fantastic Mr Fox. On 30 March, Dave Slater, Natural England's director for wildlife licensing and enforcement cases, said the felling would ""not be detrimental to the overall conservation status of the bat populations in this area."" On   on Thursday, Tony Whitehead for the RSPB said: ""HS2 has had many years to plan and deliver this scheme, to carry out standard surveys, and obtain the appropriate licences to carry out its work and safeguard protected species. ""We should not be having professional ecologists feeling the need to legally challenge the validity of licences issued by Natural England in advance of felling trees."" HS2 Ltd, which has been asked to comment on the challenges, plans to create a new woodland, planting 22,000 trees, which will  , connecting it to another wood. It told the BBC: ""We do not remove trees without having the appropriate licences in place and extensive environmental surveys are carried out ahead of any removal works to ensure appropriate mitigations are in place to protect local wildlife.""   The estimated final cost of the HS2 project is now more than £100bn. Mr Slater said on Thursday that Natural England could not comment on the ongoing legal action.

56,HS2: Tree-felling at 'Roald Dahl wood' paused by High Court,"The legal action was brought by Mark Keir from  . Jones' Hill Wood near Wendover in Buckinghamshire is said to have inspired children's author Roald Dahl. HS2 plans to create a new 22,000-tree woodland nearby. The court will decide if the case merits a judicial review after 24 May. The felling of the wood had been delayed since last year after bats were discovered at the site, which is in the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. On 30 March, Natural England's   said: ""After careful assessment, we have determined that the felling of a small number of trees at Jones' Hill Wood will not be detrimental to the overall conservation status of the bat populations in this area."" He added ""mitigations"", including the creation of new roosts, had been put in place and Natural England was granting a bat licence that allowed tree felling to take place. Mr Keir's legal case has been brought to challenge Natural England's decision. His solicitor Lisa Foster said: ""The important principle raised in the case is that high ecological protections matter when destroying ecologically important habitat, even in the context of nationally significant infrastructure.  ""This case will give the court the opportunity to determine if Natural England failed in its regulatory duty."" , and classics like Fantastic Mr Fox are said to have taken inspiration from the beech wood. The construction and operation of Phase One of HS2 is authorised by the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Act 2017. The HS2 company plans to create a new woodland, planting 22,000 trees, which will link to the remains of Jones' Hill Wood.

57,HS2 protesters spending coronavirus lockdown in trees,"The camp at Crackley Woods, near Kenilworth, Warwickshire, consists of a roundhouse built from hay bales and covered in tarpaulin, a field kitchen, about 20 small tents and a handful of camper-vans. The landowner gave the protesters permission to set up here before lockdown, and they have continued to do so over the past six weeks.  Supporters bring food and care packages and leave them at the edge of the camp. It was originally made up of locals from the Stop HS2 campaign group, but they have been joined by people from other organisations including Extinction Rebellion.  It is possible to walk along a public bridleway which brings you through the woods to the edge of the camp, and to the fences which have been erected by HS2 contractors to keep the protesters out. On one side are mobile CCTV camera units called Armadillos, as well as HS2 staff wearing PPE who are patrolling the boundary to check for incursions.  On the other side, the protesters have built tree-houses and a gantry so they can see what's happening over the fence. Nearly all of the trees that should have been felled have been taken down over the past few weeks. The campaigners took to the treetops to try to stop the work going ahead, and a number were arrested by enforcement officers. One, known as Quercus - the Latin for oak - is a former tree surgeon. He spends most of the day in a tree-house 30ft up. He told me when he saw the trees coming down he was ""overcome with grief"" and he was willing to be arrested again to try to stop the trees being felled.  He has been at the camp for several weeks and says he feels it is important to continue the fight as the country remains in lockdown.  ""Even before we had the pandemic and lockdown, there were a vast minority of people that were able to come out and do protests like this - certainly far fewer people now,"" he said.  ""People's democratic right to protest and have their say has been taken away at this time."" Another protest group, called HS2 Rebellion says it has blockaded more than 20 other sites around the UK from London to Crackley Woods.  One member said in an online video: ""Our nurses and doctors are without PPE, yet these workers can continue because the Government deems them key workers. ""Our real key essential workers are without PPE because of projects like this."" A statement said the group ""wish to emphasise the public resistance to HS2'S destruction of our ancient woodland and wildlife habitats, and HS2'S failure to stop construction works at multiple sites breaching HSE Covid guidelines and exposing their workers, protesters, families and communities to unnecessary risk during a national health crisis"". Campaigners claim 108 ancient woodlands along the route, which has been given the go ahead by the government, are under threat. HS2 said that was an exaggeration. Paul Faulkner, chief executive of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, is a big supporter of the project. He believes it has very strong green credentials and says a tiny fraction of the country's ancient woodland will be felled.  ""HS2 is aiming to be the world's most sustainable high-speed railway. It's got a whole host of pro-environmental measures that it's introducing, and that's before we get on to the massive economic benefits that HS2 is going to bring.""  Stop HS2 has argued the economic benefits have never been proven and they believe the money would be better spent after lockdown ends.  Chief executive of HS2 Mark Thurston said 11,000 people from 2,000 companies were already working on the project and he expected that to double over the next two years.  ""We see HS2 now as having an important role in getting the economy back on its feet,"" he said.  The Department for Transport said in a statement: ""While the government's top priority is rightly to combat the spread of coronavirus, we should not delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country."" Matt Bishop grew up in Coventry and visited Crackley Woods when he was a child. He has become one of the camp's leaders. He still hopes the project - which has been given the green light by the government - can be halted.  ""We need to show the government that you cannot just draw a line across the middle of the countryside. That's just not acceptable,"" he said. The first train is not expected to roll into the new Birmingham Curzon Street station until 2029. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-52488267,2020-05-04,2

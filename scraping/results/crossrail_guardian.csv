0,Crossrail: much-delayed Elizabeth line to open on 24 May,"London’s Elizabeth line is to open on 24 May, it has been announced, with the long-delayed tunnelled central section of the £19bn Crossrail project  now ready for passengers . Transport for London (TfL) said the line would open, subject to final safety approvals, the week prior to the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. The line will massively boost transport capacity in  London  and south-east England, cutting journey times, and with a number of new stations and much longer, spacious trains. A megalopolis of engineering: the verdict on London’s £18bn new Elizabeth line Read more The Elizabeth line will initially operate as three separate railways, with the overground services already running as  TfL  Rail in the west and east planned to join directly with the centre from this autumn. The new underground section will start operating 12 trains an hour between Paddington and Abbey Wood from Monday to Saturday, between 6.30am and 11pm. Engineering work will continue through the nights and on Sundays, with testing and software updates to allow for more intensive services. Later this year 22 trains an hour are planned to run at peak times in central London. TfL’s commissioner, Andy Byford, who staked his reputation on completing the line before the 30 June deadline he inherited after Crossrail’s construction delays multiplied, said: “We are using these final few weeks to continue to build up reliability on the railway and get the Elizabeth line ready to welcome customers. “The opening day is set to be a truly historic moment for the capital and the UK, and we look forward to showcasing a simply stunning addition to our network.” Map of the central section of the Elizabeth line The mayor of London,  Sadiq Khan , said the opening of the Elizabeth line would help build a “safer, fairer, greener and more prosperous city for all Londoners”. He said: “This is the most significant addition to our transport network in decades and will revolutionise travel across the capital and the south-east, as well as delivering a £42bn boost to the whole UK economy and hundreds of thousands of new homes and jobs.” ” The transport secretary,  Grant Shapps , accused Khan of breaking pre-election purdah by announcing the date of the opening the day before the capital votes on who will run its local councils, and said he was referring him to the Electoral Commission for investigation. Although the line was partially funded and originally cosponsored by the Department for Transport, and construction work was launched when the current prime minister was mayor, Shapps appeared to see the announcement as a boost for Labour in London. He said: “This announcement is an act of breathtaking political cynicism by the mayor, breaking election rules on such announcements in an effort to garner votes the day before the local elections in London.” A spokesperson for the mayor – who is not standing for election – said the announcement was made by TfL for operational reasons, and the DfT was notified well in advance, raising no concerns. Khan accused the transport secretary of being a “sourpuss”, saying: “I’m not going to get into mud-slinging like Shapps is. He needs to grow up and join the party.” The mayor said: “We’ve only got 20 days to make sure that the rotas are sorted out, that the trains are ready, that the stations are ready, so that it opens on 24 May. “The sourpuss secretary of state for transport, I’m afraid, is another example of the government’s anti-London stance.” The Elizabeth line was originally due to open under central London in December 2018, before Crossrail’s then executives  admitted the project was far behind schedule , only months before the official opening. The scheme, which includes 10 new stations and 26 miles of new tunnels, escalated in budget from £14.8bn to £18.9bn. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Part of the delay and cost has been due to Crossrail’s complicated signalling, which integrates three different systems. Trains will run automatically in the central tunnels but need to switch to different signalling systems on the eastern section of the railway to Shenfield and on the lines to Reading and Heathrow in the west. Until that system is fully operational, passengers travelling on the existing TfL Rail outer branches will need to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street stations. Trains from east and west will directly cross the central section later this year, and services running all the way through are expected to start next year. More signs with the purple livery of the Elizabeth line will be uncovered in the coming weeks, as well as the updated tube map showing the connections with the rest of the TfL network. Bus services will also be changed in east London to connect with the new stations. Bond Street station, a Crossrail site that has been beset by construction problems, will not be open for Elizabeth line services when they commence, but TfL said there had been “good progress” and it is expected to be in use by the end of 2022.

1,Start of final Crossrail trials in London raises hope of early 2022 opening,"Hopes that  Crossrail  will open in central London in early 2022 – this time on schedule – have been boosted as the troubled £19bn scheme moved into its final phase of testing at the weekend. The start of months of trial operations, which will involve thousands of volunteer passengers to test how the system will function, including in emergencies, was described as a “significant milestone” by  Transport  for London and the mayor. TfL bosses have committed to open the line in full in the first half of next year, after the former Crossrail leadership downplayed problems that escalated into vast overspending and delay from its  planned 2018 launch . Initially, passengers will need to change trains between the new  central underground section  and the services already running from Reading in the west and Shenfield in the east, but TfL hopes that some trains could run from suburbs across the city centre by next autumn, ahead of a May 2023 deadline. Testing of the railway  started in May  with up to 12 trains an hour running underground. The trial operations phase will involve more than 150 exercises over three to six months to ensure that the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, is ready for full passenger service. TfL said the tests would continue until the railway was “at the highest levels of safety and reliability”, before an exact opening date would be given. The mayor of London,  Sadiq Khan , said: “Reaching the start of trial operations is a significant milestone in the delivery of the Elizabeth line. The next few months are crucial to making sure the railway can open safely next year, and everyone is working incredibly hard to reach that goal.” Andy Byford, TfL’s commissioner , said there had been “huge progress … it is great to now enter this final stretch”. He said he believed the controversy and past problems would be forgotten once the line opened, as “a stunning addition, the jewel in the UK’s crown”. Costs will be minimised by an early opening date. Byford has pledged to deliver within the final budget specified by the outgoing board, although  £275m of that money  has yet to be made available from the government or Greater London Authority. Even before the pandemic, Crossrail’s opening was regarded as critical to ensure TfL’s finances could remain on budget. The line will increase total passenger capacity by 10% and expand the potential revenue for the capital, whose transport system has been heavily reliant on tube fares. The importance was underscored by fresh warnings over TfL’s precarious position before a key budget meeting on Wednesday, with London’s emergency funding deal from the government set to expire on 11 December. TfL has said it will need an extra £1.7bn until March 2023 to run services, with passenger numbers only at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels on the tube. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Talks have yet to start on extending financial support from central government – and although  previous deals during Covid  have been agreed at the 11th hour, there are fears in London that the Treasury, which  slashed planned rail spending  on HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail last week, will withhold funds. TfL said the lack of confirmed funding would force it to prepare for “managed decline” of the transport network. London’s finances have been worsened, it revealed, by the success of the  recently expanded ultra-low emission zone  in encouraging drivers to sell polluting vehicles. Drivers of older petrol and most diesel vehicles are charged £12.50 or more daily under the clean air scheme. About 90% of vehicles are now exempt – up from 39% in February 2017 when plans for the expanded area were made public – improving air quality but reducing expected revenues by up to £600m over the next three years.

2,Crossrail begins testing trains on the Elizabeth line in London,"Test train services have begun running under London on the Crossrail project, boosting confidence that the  Elizabeth line  should finally open to customers within a year. Four trains an hour are operating as part of rigorous safety testing, described as a “crucial milestone” in the development of the £19bn east-west rail link across the capital. The trial runs will be followed by tests of the stations and systems later this year. Crossrail said it was on track to open in early 2022, although the  Transport  for London commissioner, Andy Byford, has held out hopes that the line could be in operation by Christmas, just over three years behind the original schedule. “Reaching this crucial project milestone of running trains through the tunnels is a real testament to the teams who have worked so hard to get the railway ready for trials to ensure we can operate safely and reliably,” he said. “There is still much to do, but I know everyone is pulling together and when we open the Elizabeth line it will make a real difference to those travelling across  London .” Trains are now running in tests along the length of the line, combining the new tunnelled underground sections with the overground stretches of the Great Western and Eastern mainlines, eventually linking Reading in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex.  Combining the three different stretches, which run on separate signalling systems, had been one of the main engineering  difficulties Crossrail encountered  as its budget spiralled upwards and  repeated delays  were announced from 2018. Construction of the revamped Tottenham Court Road station, set to become one of London’s busiest interchanges, has now been completed.

3,A megalopolis of engineering: the verdict on London’s £18bn new Elizabeth line,"T he longest medieval cathedral in the world, Winchester, is 170 metres (558ft) from end to end. The new stations on the Elizabeth line are 240 metres (788ft) or more long, and sometimes nine or 10 storeys underground. And these are only the most visible manifestations of the vast volumes hollowed out of the  London  soil to achieve an underground railway bigger and faster than any before, of what was at one point the largest transport engineering project in Europe, decades and billions of pounds in the making, a system more technologically complex, says its chief executive, than any outside China.  Sometime soon – those in charge won’t be more specific than “the first half of 2022” – 10 of these stations on the central section of the line will open. Another, Bond Street,  will open a little later . To visit them now and ride the distance-shrinking trains, as I did over the past three weeks, is eerie and impressive. It is an alternate universe of London transport, hitherto unseen. Everything – trains, signs, lights, doors, advertisements – is up and running. It’s just that there aren’t yet any passengers. It is as if you took a traditional underground line and pressed a three-dimensional enlarge button. The trains will carry up to 1,500 passengers, which is nearly twice as many as, for example, the Piccadilly line, at rates (eventually) of up to 24 trains per hour. At Liverpool Street the platforms extend enough to reach what, in the old money of not-supersized tubes, is a wholly different station, Moorgate. To return to the Central line after the Elizabeth line feels like Alice in Wonderland after she ate her enlarging cake When the line is fully joined up and operational – in 2023, we’re told – its 73 miles (118km) of track, 26 miles (42km) of it in new tunnels, will run uninterrupted east-west, across the capital and beyond. It will go from Reading in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south-east London. To return to the cramped old Central line after a visit to the Elizabeth line is to feel like Alice in Wonderland after she ate her enlarging cake. This megalopolis of engineering currently lies there, pristine, unspotted by gum or pigeon, with its 319-tonne trains gliding quietly through every few minutes, empty, so that those operating the system can familiarise themselves with the choreography of all that heavy metal. Electronic indicator boards announce their coming with white digits, a notch classier than the orange ones on the old tube.

Photograph: John Zammit/Crossrail Ltd The coming of the Elizabeth line, formerly known as  Crossrail , has long been a background hum. Its opening was formerly promised for 2018, then 2019, then some time between  October 2020 and March 2021 . But few appreciate the scale of its potential impact. London’s underground railway network, which has been growing in fits and starts since the  1860s , is about to expand by 10%. The line will in effect make the city bigger, putting an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of central London. It will run through some of the poshest and poorest places, Bond Street in the West End and Custom House, Newham, in the east. It will take half an hour to get from the centre of the capital to Heathrow.  The line sprinkles real estate fairy dust everywhere it goes. Woolwich, the military and ex-industrial district of south-east London, whose connections formerly consisted of buses, sluggish trains and a quaint but cumbersome ferry across the Thames, now finds itself 15 minutes from the City of London. Here sprout the towers and blocks of a 5,000-home development by the Berkeley Group. Through the centre of the city, high-specification office buildings and apartment blocks are blossoming, in places fertilised by the underground engineering. Enthusiasm for the line unites the Green party’s London assembly member and former leader Siân Berry with the prime minister, Boris Johnson. “It’s genuinely a really, really good project,” she says. “It’s game-changing for London.” Johnson, as mayor of London, called it “a huge success for the UK economy” and a “transformative new railway”. Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary, calls it “a huge boost to transport capacity in London, a huge extension of the effective commuting zone into central London”. The dig uncovered pieces of a woolly mammoth’s jawbone, flint tools, Roman coins, Tudor shoes and numerous skeletons All of which raises questions. The spirit of the project is that of an era of London boosterism, when it seemed that this “world city” could only become bigger, richer and more dazzling, and that this direction of travel would without question be magnificent and beneficial to the whole country, an attitude that took a severe knock with Brexit and has received more blows since. The pandemic reduced the attractions of drawing millions into densely populated city centres. If working from home, at least some of the time, is here to stay, a giant people-moving machine might become less essential. Transport for London (TfL) faces a post-Covid-19  funding crisis , inauspicious for the opening of such an ambitious work. The effects of the  Ukrainian conflict  and of  sanctions on Russia , economic and otherwise, remain to be seen. It’s worth asking whether giant projects such as the Elizabeth line are the way of the future. It has cost  £18.25bn , and it is 33 years since it was proposed in its current form in something called the  Central London Railway Study . It can take a generation, in other words, to make something such as this happen. Since we are in a climate emergency, whatever environmental benefits may come from further such splurges on public transport – which incur upfront carbon and energy costs in their construction – may now come too late. Some gurus of mobility argue that driverless electric cars, by using road space efficiently and removing the environmental problems of petrol and diesel, will eventually push urban railways towards obsolescence.

Photograph: © Crossrail Ltd And, given that the government has expressed its belief in levelling up other parts of the country, especially in the Midlands and north, huge investment in London’s already extensive transport infrastructure may seem less compelling now than in the past. “I’m sure it’s a splendid piece of technology,” says John Whitelegg, visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University and an expert in sustainable transport, “but the government told Liverpool it couldn’t have a tram system. How dare we spend £18bn on  Crossrail .” T he essential characteristics of the Crossrail concept are that it is a big, fast train that goes from one side of the capital to the other – a heavy railway placed underground. Its origins go back at least to the 1940s (though some trace it to an idea mooted in the 19th century), when it was proposed as part of the postwar reconstruction of London. The name Crossrail came out of a 1974 study that estimated its cost at £300m. The  1989 Central London Rail Study  developed the concept, and further work was done in the 1990s and 2000s. Still, though, central government balked at paying for it. The financial crisis of 2008 seemed to put the project in jeopardy – how could such expenditure be justified when the government was running out of money? – but an act of parliament was passed and both main parties committed to building it. Contractors were appointed, preliminary works started, land acquired, obstacles – which included the venerable  London Astoria  music venue near Tottenham Court Road – demolished. Crossrail route map Quick Guide Six of the Elizabeth line's star stations, by Rowan Moore Show Paddington The station at Paddington, designed by Weston Williamson, descends in a deep chasm from the former taxi rank alongside Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s famous Victorian terminus. Sturdy columns and large disc-shaped light fittings give a sense of substance and scale. The 120-metre glass canopy above is printed with Cloud Index, a changing image of the sky by the American artist Spencer Finch, which is part of the line’s extensive programme of public art. Bond Street Like most of the Elizabeth line’s central stations, Bond Street comes with significant new development above ground, including a large new commercial building in Hanover Square. Colonnades around the entrances have been designed by the architects John McAslan + Partners to give “a great sense of openness and civic presence”. It has been called the line’s “problem station”, with an increase in budget from £111m to £660m, and its opening will be delayed. Tottenham Court Road The new station exits at one end at the foot of Centre Point, the famous and now-listed 1960s tower. At the other it emerges into the heart of Soho. The architects Hawkins\Brown has given them “daytime” and “night‑time” characters, one bright and airy, the other finished in dark terrazzo. At platform level there is a network of Grimshaw-designed tunnels and passages, luminous and uncluttered. Liverpool Street The length of the Elizabeth line platforms means that those at Liverpool Street reach to the next station on the old underground system, Moorgate. A long subterranean avenue runs from one to the other, with the curving concrete-clad vaults that Grimshaw Architects has designed for several stations. The entrances and exits, by the architects WilkinsonEyre, are animated by shallow fan patterns in concrete and steel. Whitechapel Formerly a cramped and convoluted tube station, Whitechapel is now bridged by an ample new concourse, and oversailed by a swooping roof, which its architects BDP says will help connect communities on either side of the tracks. Like all new Elizabeth line stations, it is wheelchair-accessible to platform level. Some of the details are clunky, but the new station gives new grandeur and dignity to the daily commute. Woolwich The area famous for its old armaments factories, poorly connected until now, is being transformed by the Elizabeth line. A development of 5,000 homes is going up around it, by property company Berkeley Homes, which also helped to build the station and provided the land for it. The architects Weston Williamson has given it a military theme, with strips of regimental colour on its bronze-clad columns Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. In 2012 four pairs of  1,000-tonne, £10m tunnel boring machines , giant mechanical moles with the canteen and toilet facilities of a small ship, started chewing through the subterranean mud. Huge caverns were formed, and 7m tonnes of earth expelled, three-quarters of it to form a new nature reserve at Wallasea Island in Essex. Three-tonne sections of concrete, to make tunnels meant to last at least 120 years, were installed with heft and precision. The route had to be plotted with care, snaking around to avoid the foundations of skyscrapers, sewers and other underground tunnels. The operation had byproducts: it became the largest archaeological dig in Britain, uncovering pieces of a woolly mammoth’s jawbone, flint tools, Roman coins, Tudor shoes, Victorian pickle jars and numerous skeletons, many of them those of plague victims. Community centres were redecorated, a city farm spruced up, a literary festival supported, as part of a programme to support the neighbourhoods where the works took place. Public art, including the mile-plus-long  “Newham wall”  on which the locally raised Sonia Boyce controversially mentioned the murder rate in the area of north Woolwich, was extensively commissioned. It is a rule of construction that time and money, paramount before a project is completed, are rapidly forgotten thereafter The  last time I wrote about Crossrail , in 2013, which involved exploring deep vaults of concrete and clay, I heard confident-going-on-hubristic claims about its delivery within time and its then budget of £14.8bn. “Do not underestimate UK plc’s ability to deliver such projects,” the then Crossrail chief executive Andrew Wolstenholme told me; Britain “has developed a skill set and a reputation second to none”. It didn’t quite work out like that. “We got ourselves into a pickle,” says Mark Wild, who became chief executive in 2018, with the task of sorting things out. The civil engineering – the heavy stuff – had gone well, “a brilliant, brilliant job”, completed in about 2015. But “we got into a muddle” with all the systems that go into it, “the immense density of digitisation”, the “world’s most complex signalling”. It is, though, a common rule of construction that time and money, which seem paramount before a project is completed, are rapidly forgotten thereafter. Few who swipe their cards on the ticket barriers will be much bothered about the difference between nearly £15bn and £18bn-plus, and the four-year delay will be forgotten. What they will see are what Andy Byford, who has been London’s transport commissioner since May 2020, calls “aesthetically stunning” stations. “I think people will be blown away when they see the scale and the very pleasant environments.” Canary Wharf Elizabeth line station.  Photograph: Uyen Luu/Crossrail Ltd There is some history to the design of underground train stations. There are the palatial caverns of Moscow, rococo and neo-classical, ballroom-like, encrusted with sculpture and painting. There are the more restrained structures – such as the chaste rotunda and semi-rotunda that respectively stand over  Arnos Grove  in north London and Chiswick Park in the west – built under the leadership of  Frank Pick , who was chief executive of London Transport in its glory years in the 1930s. These are elegant and considered, with touches of quality in bronze or stone, part of a unified vision of a well-designed public service that also included signs, typefaces, advertising and the famous  London underground map . The Elizabeth line architecture is more in the Frank Pick tradition than Moscow’s. “We’re not being extravagant,” Byford is at pains to say. “We don’t have chandeliers.” Instead you get what they call “line-wide design”, by the engineer Atkins, Grimshaw Architects, the designer Maynard and the lighting designer GIA Equation, whereby seats and fire equipment and all the other paraphernalia of stations are marshalled into a consistent, robust and uncluttered design. Speakers, signs and lights are organised into free-standing “totems”. In the stations that are tunnelled (as opposed to being placed in boxes), the same systems of curving concrete panels are employed throughout. Full-scale mock-ups were built to make sure it would all fit together well. The idea is to be calm and clear, a world away from the muck and rattle of the old tube The effect is luminous. Visual bric-a-brac is kept under control, and advertising is restricted to those places where it will be most noticed; for example, on video screens next to the doors to the trains, which leaves expanses of pale walls, softly uplit, scored by the joints in the concrete and perforated above head height for acoustic reasons. Where one passage joins another the corners are rounded, which will ease the flow of people. It also makes for pleasing shapes where one curve meets another, the concrete folding like handkerchiefs in the wind, of a complexity that would be impossible without digital design and manufacturing. These large pieces of people-plumbing feel smooth and homogeneous, as if formed out of a single substance. The idea is to be calm and clear, a world away from the muck and rattle of the old tube, and to help people find their way around. Given the length of the platforms, a wrong turning by a passenger could result in a long, wasted walk. Then, in the sections that connect to the streets above, the designs become more individual and bespoke, in response to the particularities of the neighbourhood. Ten different architectural practices have designed the 11 stations of the central section, making them a showcase for the more engineering-minded end of British architecture. At Tottenham Court Road, Hawkins\Brown Architects has given different characters to the entrances at the opposite ends of the station: a “nocturnal” connection in dark terrazzo to the fleshpots of Soho, a light and airy “daytime” one at the other end. Weston Williamson, the architect for Woolwich, has designed a disciplined file of sturdy columns, bronze-clad at their base, decorated with strips in the colours of the regiments associated with the area’s historic military facilities. The ceiling at Liverpool Street station.  Photograph: Chris Bevan Lee/Crossrail Ltd The project’s architects like to exploit the drama given to them by the engineering, such as deep plunges down from pavement level at Paddington and Tottenham Court Road. WilkinsonEyre, at Liverpool Street, has conceived a concrete vault that folds like shallow origami, whose triangular patterns are echoed in aluminium panels on the escalator walls. The firm has also made a thing of the crisscross trusses of an office block above the station’s western entrance, which carry the new building over the big open spaces below. These stations feel more orderly and managed than those of the Jubilee line extension, completed in 1999, at the time a bold and famous adventure in architectural commissioning. The  late Will Alsop , who designed the moodily dramatic dark blue North Greenwich station for the Jubilee line, initially worked on Paddington for the Elizabeth line, but the job eventually went to Weston Williamson, also a veteran of the Jubilee line, but more level-headed. Sometimes, in the new stations, calm and consistent translates as bland. A few details, as a result of the ways in which large buildings are now procured and built, clunk. The stations tend to get less convincing where they engage with their messy surroundings at street level, more so when they get close to trains and engineering. But the dominant impressions are of handsomeness and amplitude, expressed in big circular light fittings at Paddington or the high-ceilinged rebuild of the formerly crabby layout of Whitechapel. This composite work of architecture is one to which some people have given the best part of their careers. Julian Robinson, the project’s head of architecture, has been working on it (with breaks to work on the Jubilee line and the London 2012 Olympics) since 1992. Roger Hawkins of Hawkins\Brown tells how his wife gave birth to their son the night after he was interviewed for the Tottenham Court Road commission. The lad will turn 30 next week. One of the project’s most remarkable achievements is its unity and cohesion, given the multiplicity of consultants, contractors, suppliers and commissioning organisations. This is not the work of a single public body but of multiple partnerships with the private sector. The stations at Woolwich and Canary Wharf, for example, were built by the private developers that own the respective sites. S o this queen of tubes, branded in royal purple, will hopefully open in time for its namesake’s  platinum jubilee . The purpose of the architecture is not just vanity, but also to raise the desirability and prestige of public transport, so as encourage people out of cars. The stations will also give a lift to their neighbourhoods – not much needed in Bond Street, perhaps, but helpful in some of the less favoured places touched by the line. The line will, says Byford, be “the ultimate symbol of London’s re-emergence from Covid, a massive morale boost”. Berry says: “A car-free recovery is exactly what we need. It will make a difference to many people’s perceptions.” Wild says: “The asset that we have built is one of this century’s great engineering achievements.”  Byford acknowledges that the pandemic “has driven coach and horses” through TfL’s plans, and is worried about short-term underfunding, which could lead to a “downward spiral” of managed decline, but he says that the business case for the Elizabeth line “is still compelling”. Pre-Covid, the prediction for passenger numbers in 2026 was 250 million. “Now it’s 130-170 million but could be 200 million.” An architect’s image of Bond Street’s significant above-ground development. Described as the project’s ‘problem station’, the Bond Street Elizabeth line station will be delayed.  Photograph: Crossrail Tony Travers, visiting professor at the London School of Economics’s department of government, believes that London will bounce back: “If plague and cholera and the second world war and deindustrialisation didn’t do for London, you have to assume that it will survive.” In which case the Elizabeth line, “whose case was based on the ever-growing density of London”, will be justified. On the question of levelling up, the line’s fans have many answers. One is the amount of work that its construction created nationwide: 75,000 people have worked on Crossrail, says Wild, “the majority of them all over the country”. He cites trains from Derby, vitreous enamel signs from the Isle of Wight, fire doors from Bolton, fibre communications from Ashby de la Zouch. Travers argues that failure to invest in London’s transport would be a case of levelling down, not up. In which case global companies such as Google wouldn’t look to locate in other British cities, but international rivals such as Amsterdam. He points out that most of the funding of the Elizabeth line comes not from central government but from business rates, levies on development and other sources within the capital. Also, that London has large areas of deprivation that are as much in need of levelling up as anywhere else. None of which satisfies Whitelegg. Transport spending per head, he says, citing a  2018 report , is £944 per head per year in London, compared with £314 in the West Midlands. It would be much better to invest in local integrated networks of buses and cycling of a kind that he has worked on in Germany and elsewhere that benefit “more people more immediately at lower cost”. He argues that there is a remarkable lack of evidence for the Elizabeth line’s alleged environmental benefits. Curving concrete panels and free-standing signage ‘totems’ at Tottenham Court Road.  Photograph: Rowan Moore What the Midlands and north have been offered instead is the  HS2  high-speed rail link, costing about £100bn, of  uncertain delivery date  and whose scale makes the Elizabeth line look like a Tri-ang Hornby toy. Meanwhile, London’s  Crossrail 2 , a north-south version of the same idea, has been put on hold.  Travers points out that infrastructure projects are not conceived in conditions of calm objectivity, but reflect such things as the lobbying power of particular cities – in the case of the Elizabeth line, the City of London and an organisation called London First did much to push the project through. The mighty construction industry that builds such projects also has political momentum. What gets built is not theoretically the best solution, but the most likely to be achieved in the circumstances. It is never really possible to know, once it’s built, how a given project would compare with imaginary alternatives. So maybe there is a better, smarter £18bn theoretical transport project than the one that is about to open, that will never be seen. There is good reason to believe that there are better, smarter alternatives to HS2. But, for now, the natural reaction to the Elizabeth line is to be deeply impressed.

4,‘It has to be flawless’: long wait for London’s Elizabeth line is nearly over,"T he Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief told a press tour on Monday, amid speculation that the £18.9bn  Crossrail  project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. On the first media trip to see the line in action, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street, flaws appeared conspicuously absent. Twelve trains an hour are now running in the central section excavated under the capital, with an official deadline for opening at the end of June. Transport commissioner Andy Byford.  Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said the opening would be “a massive fillip to London’s morale and confidence” after the capital was drained of so much life during the pandemic. “When people arrive, day one, they will be blown away by the scale and by how quiet and smooth the train ride is.” On the concourse below the glass roof of Paddington’s Elizabeth line station, Byford’s words seemed no exaggeration, with trains arriving barely audibly behind the screens sealing the track from the platforms. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said it was “epic, a beautiful outcome”. Most of the volumes of the  newly built stations , such as the control rooms, aren’t even visible, he said: “The Shard would fit in here quite comfortably.” Passenger access to the Elizabeth line.  Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian For passengers, there is little “clutter”, as he puts it: upgraded information screens are above the automatic doors on platforms; all the trains are fully accessible. On board, it is hard to imagine the trains crowded – each carries up to 1,500 people – but they are wide and high enough to contain two rows of straps for any who do stand, and none should have to crick their neck beside a door. The scale is such that to walk to the cab for a driver’s eye view takes a good couple of minutes; at Liverpool Street, where the platform curves into the distance, one end comes out at Moorgate, a whole other stop on the tube till now. The project is in its final  trial operations phase , when volunteers are encouraged to dawdle, block the doors and get in the way, to see how it stands up to routine use. Bigger exercises with 1,000 people are due to be carried out, including staged emergencies ranging from fires to gun attacks – complete with huge cans of soup to simulate, for example, the vomit of a fainting passenger.

It will instead be ready in late 2022, when direct through-trains from the west and east sections that run to Reading or Shenfield respectively will also start running under central London.

Now, though, it is tantalisingly close. However, Byford said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “It has to be flawless. Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability,” he said. “Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” Topics London London Underground Transport Transport policy Crossrail The Queen Rail transport features Reuse this content",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/it-has-to-be-flawless-long-wait-for-londons-elizabeth-line-is-nearly-over,2022-02-08
5,Crossrail 2: more than £115m spent before project mothballed,"More than £115m was spent on  Crossrail  2 before work on the scheme for a new north-south rail line through London was suspended in November. The costs for the development and design of the line, which was once hoped to be operational in the early 2030s, were shared between the Department for  Transport  and Transport for London. However,  work was officially paused  as part of the emergency financial agreement between the government and TfL to fund the capital’s transport network after passenger revenues dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic. Around a quarter of the money spent went to Network Rail, the state-owned railway infrastructure manager, according to figures revealed by  New Civil Engineer . The biggest private sector beneficiaries were Arup, whose design consultancy work on the tunnels and southern section totalled almost £12m, and Arcadis, which was paid £11.4m for engineering consultancy. The line would have linked stations in the home counties to the north and south-west of the capital via new tunnels underneath central  London , roughly along the route of the Chelsea-Hackney underground line first discussed in the 1970s. Central development funding was allotted from 2015-16 when construction of the original  Crossrail  line appeared to be on time and on budget, and when Crossrail 2 was  regarded as an essential part of the plan  for handling HS2 passengers arriving in London Euston – a prospect that is in doubt. The division within  TfL  that was working on Crossrail 2 was seconded to other work after Covid-19 hit London last year. TfL said that while the project was mothballed, land would remain safeguarded and the design work would remain relevant. A TfL spokesperson said: “The pandemic, and subsequent impact on our finances, has meant that we have to be realistic about what is currently affordable.” A planned Bakerloo line extension for the underground is also on ice. The spokesperson added: “Our immediate priority for these schemes is progressing safeguarding as they are still likely to be needed in the future to support long-term growth and modal shift in London. The work developing proposals for these schemes will still be used when we are in a position to confirm funding in future.” Topics Crossrail Coronavirus Rail industry TfL Transport Transport policy London Reuse this content",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/18/crossrail-2-more-than-115m-spent-before-project-mothballed,2021-01-18
6,Crossrail work to continue after £825m government loan,"Work to complete  Crossrail  will continue after a last-minute £825m loan to London from the government kept the delayed rail line from a “disastrous” mothballing. Transport for London said the new financing would allow work to carry on “at pace” to open the new railway in 2022 – but the political row simmered on between the mayor and ministers over whether the capital was being unfairly treated in the coronavirus pandemic. Crossrail  announced in August that it would require more funds  after putting back its opening date a further year from 2021, partly due to distancing requirements for safe working. The  London  mayor, Sadiq Khan, said that ministers had insisted London pay the shortfall on the £18.7bn project, a joint venture between TfL and the national government, “despite the overwhelming majority of the tax income that will result from Crossrail going to the Treasury”. Khan said: “This is another example of London supporting the country way over and above the help we get from this government. I do not want this project to be stalled so it is vital that we dig deep to get the railway up and running.” The government agreed  £1.8bn of emergency Covid-19 financing  for TfL last month to help tackle the huge loss in revenues since passengers were told to avoid travel, but excluded Crossrail funding at the time. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “The government remains committed to the rapid completion of the project, in a way that is fair to UK taxpayers, and has committed to financing the completion of Crossrail. However, London – as the primary beneficiary – must ultimately bear any additional costs.” He added that the government would “take all necessary steps to complete the project without requiring further additional funding”, while TfL was commissioning further independent analysis of costs. Huge problems with the construction of stations along the new railway under central London were revealed only  months before its original planned December 2018 opening , followed by difficulties in harmonising an overly complex signalling system. Speaking to the London assembly transport committee after the announcement, Andy Byford, the TfL commissioner, said there would be “no further slippage” and that he and Crossrail had “a very clear understanding of the work still to do”. Byford said that the funding deal “came down to the wire” and that no agreement “would have been disastrous: we would have had to mothball the project – it was grim reality, we would have had to stop work, we would have had no financial authority”. With the money, he said: “We will be pragmatic, we may choose to park a few things - none safety critical, none public facing – to get the railway open. I’m crystal clear: no further slippage, no further recourse to public funding over and above what was previously identified by the outgoing Crossrail board.” The outgoing board had identified a £1.1bn budget overrun and the deputy London mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, admitted the government might still be asked to fund the remaining £275m. She said the delayed opening would also increase TfL’s losses by £200m, to a total of £1.3bn, in budgeted revenues from the Elizabeth line (as Crossrail will be known). The current deal will see the Greater London Authority borrow up to £825m from the Department for Transport, to pass on as a grant to TfL. The GLA will repay the loan from business rate supplements and levies on developers. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said delivery of the Elizabeth line was “in its complex final stages”, with more work to do on building the infrastructure before a year of intensive testing of the system could start in 2021. The Elizabeth line, capable of moving more than half a million passengers daily, would boost the UK economy by £42bn, according to TfL.

7,Crossrail is a memorial to another London – one that expected to prosper for ever | Ian Jack,"I n the tangle of west London’s railway junctions – out Willesden way, where trains creak around tight curves, attempting to circumvent the  London  termini – I recently came across lines of new carriages waiting for work. I think it was at that famous railway placename Old Oak Common, where the smoke from the locomotive sheds once lay black across the sky. Several long sidings were filled with them: new, in a livery of shining white, with the London  Transport  roundel emblazoned on their sides – in purple and crossed with the words ELIZABETH LINE. The sight gave me a stab of longing for a time of greater certainty, pre-Brexit and pre-Covid, when the most problematic aspect of London’s future, the levels of inequality among the population apart, was its apparently unstoppable growth. In the  words of a report  published by Oxford Economics, the city’s economy was “growing strongly, easily outpacing both the UK and its nearest European rivals such as Paris and Frankfurt”. What the report called “significant investments” in public infrastructure, office buildings, retail, and flats and houses pointed to a widespread optimism that the growth would continue “not just for the next year or two but for many years to come”. The report wondered how confident London should be about its growth trajectory – how a crisis in the eurozone or the possibility of the UK’s departure from the EU might affect it – but the answer seemed to be: pretty confident, all things considered. That was in March 2016. Crossrail , which the Queen renamed after herself the previous month, is the largest of these public investments. The east-west link across the capital was first proposed in the 1940s. Construction began in 2009 with a promised finishing date of 2018 for the line’s 73 miles, which in 2018 was put back to 2019 and now, after further postponements, is forecast to be  early 2022 .  It has been a grand project.  Thirteen miles of twin tunnels  were bored under the city and 8m tonnes of earth removed, most of it to  Wallasea Island  in Essex, where it forms the foundations of a nature reserve. Its trains are, or were, expected to carry 200 million passengers a year, simplifying and quickening their previous journeys and relieving overcrowding on other lines. Its estimated cost has predictably risen, from  £15.9bn to £18.25bn , and over the next two years may rise further; but in 2022, all being well, a traveller from the City of London will reach Heathrow in 33 minutes, and with any luck have a seat all the way. For the present, the most the commuter can do is travel by new trains on the old routes from Berkshire and Essex to Paddington and Liverpool Street. The tunnels that connect the two terminals can be experienced only  in photographs . Pristine, beautifully lit, populated only by a few engineers in hard hats and smart orange overalls, their curved emptiness suggests a memorial. If the future obeys conventional wisdom and the commuting habit begins to die – with workers working onscreen at home, or in cheaper offices in the outer suburbs, or coming into the city less regularly, off-peak and two days a week rather than five – then these tunnels might come to mark the turning point of a tide in human traffic that has been rising since railways first reached London in the late 1830s – rising and widening, so that people are sucked every morning from quite distant towns and cities (Weymouth, Norwich, Grantham, Bath) to serve the metropolitan economy. Of course, conventional wisdom could be wrong, and London could go back to business as usual. I look most days at the windows of estate agents in our London high street, and expect to see the prices fall, as ordinary sense suggests they would. But they never do; perhaps prices are sustained by the fall in sterling’s value, making property cheaper for the foreign speculator. The Elizabeth line might keep up a similar appearance of success, not by expanding the market but by stealing commuters from other routes, leaving them half-empty and vulnerable to the axe. Bad luck or poor timing can spoil the best-laid scheme. Some projects, conveniently for their supporters, become too late to stop. “That ship has sailed” has become the justification for HS2, just as it was in the 1960s when an incoming Labour government looked as if it might cancel the Polaris nuclear submarine programme, as promised in the manifesto. The Admiralty  told Harold Wilson  that construction of the first two submarines had “passed the point of no return”, so Wilson’s administration went on to complete them and a further two; in this murk, the huge and continuing expense of Britain’s “independent nuclear deterrent” was born. Other projects succeed despite their birth in the late afternoon of optimism, just before sunset and a chilly dusk. When in 1911 Britain decided to  move its Indian capital  from Kolkata to New Delhi it imagined that sunset would never come. George V laid the foundation stone; the leading English architects  Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker  were appointed; and over the next 20 years a majestic imperial headquarters was created, at considerable and often criticised expense. It was, from the British point of view, a folly: when the new city was eventually inaugurated, British rule had only 16 years left to run. Independent India, on the other hand, inherited a capital that had been barely worn, a planned city whose broad avenues and handsome architecture made it among the most attractive in the world. That was a good outcome. There is another kind. Growing up in postwar industrial Scotland I often met  Ozymandias , in the shape of ruins created by an excess of confidence 50 years before. Ozy could be encountered in all kinds of locations, but perhaps most memorably in the west end of Glasgow, among the stone terraces and villas of the city’s bourgeoisie, where several abandoned stations marked the Caledonian Railway’s attempt in the late 1890s to woo the rich commuter. The best Scottish architects had been hired –  James Miller and JJ Burnet  were the able counterparts of Lutyens and Baker – to produce extravagant buildings that ranged in style from “English domestic” to Muscovite cathedral. Their trade destroyed by the coming of the electric tram, most of these stations had put up their shutters by 1940, though the buildings survived long after. In the 1960s it was still a delight to turn a corner in Glasgow and come across what seemed to be the Kremlin. In the Edwardian age, the same railway opened a 40-mile line from the city’s eastern edge all the way to the Ayrshire port of Ardrossan, paralleling the older line of a rival company for most of the way. This was confidence bordering on madness; cars were already kicking up the dust of Scottish roads. But the Caledonian believed the new line would cure a problem of capacity at Glasgow docks; coal for export from the Lanarkshire mines would be shipped from Ardrossan instead. And so embankments were made, cuttings dug, stations and viaducts built, double track laid, and telegraph wire strung from post to post: all in the assumption that the Lanarkshire collieries had near-inexhaustible reserves of coal and that no new Glasgow docks would be built, assumptions that proved false. It closed after 30 years, by which time the Caledonian company itself was a memory. I imagine that at its opening some local aristocrat spoke about how the district would “prosper mightily” – the new  Johnson mantra . Like a lot of things our prime minister says, the words belong in the mouth of a man in a top hat as he cuts a ribbon – a man who, if truth be told, hasn’t the faintest idea of what comes next.

8,Crossrail 2 plans shelved as part of £1.8bn TfL funding deal,"Plans to build Crossrail 2 will be shelved as part of the  £1.8bn bailout deal  agreed by the government and Transport for London at the weekend. TfL will also have to further investigate driverless trains under the terms of the deal to provide emergency funds to the capital, which has lost billions in passenger revenue because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The details of the six-month agreement, contained in a letter from the transport secretary,  Grant Shapps , to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, force TfL to end spending on Crossrail 2. Transport for London secures £1.8bn government bailout Read more The new north-south line across the capital was described by the national infrastructure commission in 2016  as a national priority , and a department set up within TfL under Michèle Dix as managing director to drive it forward. Staff have already been seconded to other projects, it is understood. While it had been previously hoped that construction could start in the early 2020s, Crossrail 2, costing an estimated £33bn, became a  focus for anger  at the imbalance on spending on transport infrastructure between the south-east and other regions, and  lost its main champions  in the government after the EU referendum. Now the Department for  Transport  has demanded that TfL “brings an orderly end to consultancy work as soon as possible”, although it has agreed to continue to safeguard land, allowing the scheme to be potentially revived in the future. Discussions are continuing over providing more funding to the original Crossrail, which has  blown its enlarged £18bn budget  and is expected to open in 2022. TfL has also agreed to work with the government on a politically contentious study into implementing driverless trains. While technically possible – Docklands Light Railway trains are automated – TfL believes it represents poor value for money. A  leaked internal report  suggested converting the underground system and trains would require an initial capital outlay of £7bn. Nonetheless, the Shapps letter commits TfL to “work with a government-led expert review on the possible implementation of driverless trains”. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has long pushed the idea, not least during his clashes with unions during his time as mayor. The row over the bailout has been bitter, as Khan contrasted the money spent on rescuing national rail firms during the coronavirus crisis with the conditions placed on TfL, and accused Johnson of lying over the state of the capital’s finances. The government has not insisted on an  extension of the congestion charging zone , as had been signalled, nor on general fare increases. However, the increased £15 daily fee and extended hours of operation of the congestion charge will remain in place, as will limitations on free over-60s travel. Discussions will continue on longer-term funding, with  TfL keen to secure a settlement  that makes it less reliant on fare income and matches other world cities. A TfL spokesperson said: “Although we have started to utilise the skills of the  Crossrail  2 team on other business critical projects, the team continues to support the work of refreshing the 2015 safeguarding directions in order to protect the route from future development. This will ensure that the crucial infrastructure can be delivered at a time when a long-term sustainable funding model is in place.”  This article was amended on 3 November 2020 because Docklands Light Railway trains are partially automated, not fully automated as an earlier version said.

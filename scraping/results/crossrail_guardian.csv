Transport for London (TfL) said the line would open, subject to final safety approvals, the week prior to the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. The line will massively boost transport capacity in  London  and south-east England, cutting journey times, and with a number of new stations and much longer, spacious trains. A megalopolis of engineering: the verdict on London’s £18bn new Elizabeth line Read more The Elizabeth line will initially operate as three separate railways, with the overground services already running as  TfL  Rail in the west and east planned to join directly with the centre from this autumn. The new underground section will start operating 12 trains an hour between Paddington and Abbey Wood from Monday to Saturday, between 6.30am and 11pm. Engineering work will continue through the nights and on Sundays, with testing and software updates to allow for more intensive services. Later this year 22 trains an hour are planned to run at peak times in central London. TfL’s commissioner, Andy Byford, who staked his reputation on completing the line before the 30 June deadline he inherited after Crossrail’s construction delays multiplied, said: “We are using these final few weeks to continue to build up reliability on the railway and get the Elizabeth line ready to welcome customers. “The opening day is set to be a truly historic moment for the capital and the UK, and we look forward to showcasing a simply stunning addition to our network.” Map of the central section of the Elizabeth line The mayor of London,  Sadiq Khan , said the opening of the Elizabeth line would help build a “safer, fairer, greener and more prosperous city for all Londoners”. He said: “This is the most significant addition to our transport network in decades and will revolutionise travel across the capital and the south-east, as well as delivering a £42bn boost to the whole UK economy and hundreds of thousands of new homes and jobs.” ” The transport secretary,  Grant Shapps , accused Khan of breaking pre-election purdah by announcing the date of the opening the day before the capital votes on who will run its local councils, and said he was referring him to the Electoral Commission for investigation. Although the line was partially funded and originally cosponsored by the Department for Transport, and construction work was launched when the current prime minister was mayor, Shapps appeared to see the announcement as a boost for Labour in London. He said: “This announcement is an act of breathtaking political cynicism by the mayor, breaking election rules on such announcements in an effort to garner votes the day before the local elections in London.” A spokesperson for the mayor – who is not standing for election – said the announcement was made by TfL for operational reasons, and the DfT was notified well in advance, raising no concerns. Khan accused the transport secretary of being a “sourpuss”, saying: “I’m not going to get into mud-slinging like Shapps is. He needs to grow up and join the party.” The mayor said: “We’ve only got 20 days to make sure that the rotas are sorted out, that the trains are ready, that the stations are ready, so that it opens on 24 May. “The sourpuss secretary of state for transport, I’m afraid, is another example of the government’s anti-London stance.” The Elizabeth line was originally due to open under central London in December 2018, before Crossrail’s then executives  admitted the project was far behind schedule , only months before the official opening. The scheme, which includes 10 new stations and 26 miles of new tunnels, escalated in budget from £14.8bn to £18.9bn. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Part of the delay and cost has been due to Crossrail’s complicated signalling, which integrates three different systems. Trains will run automatically in the central tunnels but need to switch to different signalling systems on the eastern section of the railway to Shenfield and on the lines to Reading and Heathrow in the west. Until that system is fully operational, passengers travelling on the existing TfL Rail outer branches will need to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street stations. Trains from east and west will directly cross the central section later this year, and services running all the way through are expected to start next year. More signs with the purple livery of the Elizabeth line will be uncovered in the coming weeks, as well as the updated tube map showing the connections with the rest of the TfL network. Bus services will also be changed in east London to connect with the new stations. Bond Street station, a Crossrail site that has been beset by construction problems, will not be open for Elizabeth line services when they commence, but TfL said there had been “good progress” and it is expected to be in use by the end of 2022.

1|Start of final Crossrail trials in London raises hope of early 2022 opening|2021-11-22|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/22/start-of-final-crossrail-trials-in-london-raises-hope-of-early-2022-opening|Hopes that  Crossrail  will open in central London in early 2022 – this time on schedule – have been boosted as the troubled £19bn scheme moved into its final phase of testing at the weekend. The start of months of trial operations, which will involve thousands of volunteer passengers to test how the system will function, including in emergencies, was described as a “significant milestone” by  Transport  for London and the mayor. TfL bosses have committed to open the line in full in the first half of next year, after the former Crossrail leadership downplayed problems that escalated into vast overspending and delay from its  planned 2018 launch . Initially, passengers will need to change trains between the new  central underground section  and the services already running from Reading in the west and Shenfield in the east, but TfL hopes that some trains could run from suburbs across the city centre by next autumn, ahead of a May 2023 deadline. Testing of the railway  started in May  with up to 12 trains an hour running underground. The trial operations phase will involve more than 150 exercises over three to six months to ensure that the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, is ready for full passenger service. TfL said the tests would continue until the railway was “at the highest levels of safety and reliability”, before an exact opening date would be given. The mayor of London,  Sadiq Khan , said: “Reaching the start of trial operations is a significant milestone in the delivery of the Elizabeth line. The next few months are crucial to making sure the railway can open safely next year, and everyone is working incredibly hard to reach that goal.” Andy Byford, TfL’s commissioner , said there had been “huge progress … it is great to now enter this final stretch”. He said he believed the controversy and past problems would be forgotten once the line opened, as “a stunning addition, the jewel in the UK’s crown”. Costs will be minimised by an early opening date. Byford has pledged to deliver within the final budget specified by the outgoing board, although  £275m of that money  has yet to be made available from the government or Greater London Authority. Even before the pandemic, Crossrail’s opening was regarded as critical to ensure TfL’s finances could remain on budget. The line will increase total passenger capacity by 10% and expand the potential revenue for the capital, whose transport system has been heavily reliant on tube fares. The importance was underscored by fresh warnings over TfL’s precarious position before a key budget meeting on Wednesday, with London’s emergency funding deal from the government set to expire on 11 December. TfL has said it will need an extra £1.7bn until March 2023 to run services, with passenger numbers only at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels on the tube. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Talks have yet to start on extending financial support from central government – and although  previous deals during Covid  have been agreed at the 11th hour, there are fears in London that the Treasury, which  slashed planned rail spending  on HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail last week, will withhold funds. TfL said the lack of confirmed funding would force it to prepare for “managed decline” of the transport network. London’s finances have been worsened, it revealed, by the success of the  recently expanded ultra-low emission zone  in encouraging drivers to sell polluting vehicles. Drivers of older petrol and most diesel vehicles are charged £12.50 or more daily under the clean air scheme. About 90% of vehicles are now exempt – up from 39% in February 2017 when plans for the expanded area were made public – improving air quality but reducing expected revenues by up to £600m over the next three years.

2|Crossrail begins testing trains on the Elizabeth line in London|2021-05-12|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/12/crossrail-begins-testing-trains-on-the-elizabeth-line-in-london|Test train services have begun running under London on the Crossrail project, boosting confidence that the  Elizabeth line  should finally open to customers within a year. Four trains an hour are operating as part of rigorous safety testing, described as a “crucial milestone” in the development of the £19bn east-west rail link across the capital. The trial runs will be followed by tests of the stations and systems later this year. Crossrail said it was on track to open in early 2022, although the  Transport  for London commissioner, Andy Byford, has held out hopes that the line could be in operation by Christmas, just over three years behind the original schedule. “Reaching this crucial project milestone of running trains through the tunnels is a real testament to the teams who have worked so hard to get the railway ready for trials to ensure we can operate safely and reliably,” he said. “There is still much to do, but I know everyone is pulling together and when we open the Elizabeth line it will make a real difference to those travelling across  London .” Trains are now running in tests along the length of the line, combining the new tunnelled underground sections with the overground stretches of the Great Western and Eastern mainlines, eventually linking Reading in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex.  Combining the three different stretches, which run on separate signalling systems, had been one of the main engineering  difficulties Crossrail encountered  as its budget spiralled upwards and  repeated delays  were announced from 2018. Construction of the revamped Tottenham Court Road station, set to become one of London’s busiest interchanges, has now been completed.

3|A megalopolis of engineering: the verdict on London’s £18bn new Elizabeth line|2022-03-13|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/13/elizabeth-line-crossrail-opening-london|T he longest medieval cathedral in the world, Winchester, is 170 metres (558ft) from end to end. The new stations on the Elizabeth line are 240 metres (788ft) or more long, and sometimes nine or 10 storeys underground. And these are only the most visible manifestations of the vast volumes hollowed out of the  London  soil to achieve an underground railway bigger and faster than any before, of what was at one point the largest transport engineering project in Europe, decades and billions of pounds in the making, a system more technologically complex, says its chief executive, than any outside China.  Sometime soon – those in charge won’t be more specific than “the first half of 2022” – 10 of these stations on the central section of the line will open. Another, Bond Street,  will open a little later . To visit them now and ride the distance-shrinking trains, as I did over the past three weeks, is eerie and impressive. It is an alternate universe of London transport, hitherto unseen. Everything – trains, signs, lights, doors, advertisements – is up and running. It’s just that there aren’t yet any passengers. It is as if you took a traditional underground line and pressed a three-dimensional enlarge button. The trains will carry up to 1,500 passengers, which is nearly twice as many as, for example, the Piccadilly line, at rates (eventually) of up to 24 trains per hour. At Liverpool Street the platforms extend enough to reach what, in the old money of not-supersized tubes, is a wholly different station, Moorgate. To return to the Central line after the Elizabeth line feels like Alice in Wonderland after she ate her enlarging cake When the line is fully joined up and operational – in 2023, we’re told – its 73 miles (118km) of track, 26 miles (42km) of it in new tunnels, will run uninterrupted east-west, across the capital and beyond. It will go from Reading in Berkshire to Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south-east London. To return to the cramped old Central line after a visit to the Elizabeth line is to feel like Alice in Wonderland after she ate her enlarging cake. This megalopolis of engineering currently lies there, pristine, unspotted by gum or pigeon, with its 319-tonne trains gliding quietly through every few minutes, empty, so that those operating the system can familiarise themselves with the choreography of all that heavy metal. Electronic indicator boards announce their coming with white digits, a notch classier than the orange ones on the old tube.

Photograph: John Zammit/Crossrail Ltd The coming of the Elizabeth line, formerly known as  Crossrail , has long been a background hum. Its opening was formerly promised for 2018, then 2019, then some time between  October 2020 and March 2021 . But few appreciate the scale of its potential impact. London’s underground railway network, which has been growing in fits and starts since the  1860s , is about to expand by 10%. The line will in effect make the city bigger, putting an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of central London. It will run through some of the poshest and poorest places, Bond Street in the West End and Custom House, Newham, in the east. It will take half an hour to get from the centre of the capital to Heathrow.  The line sprinkles real estate fairy dust everywhere it goes. Woolwich, the military and ex-industrial district of south-east London, whose connections formerly consisted of buses, sluggish trains and a quaint but cumbersome ferry across the Thames, now finds itself 15 minutes from the City of London. Here sprout the towers and blocks of a 5,000-home development by the Berkeley Group. Through the centre of the city, high-specification office buildings and apartment blocks are blossoming, in places fertilised by the underground engineering. Enthusiasm for the line unites the Green party’s London assembly member and former leader Siân Berry with the prime minister, Boris Johnson. “It’s genuinely a really, really good project,” she says. “It’s game-changing for London.” Johnson, as mayor of London, called it “a huge success for the UK economy” and a “transformative new railway”. Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary, calls it “a huge boost to transport capacity in London, a huge extension of the effective commuting zone into central London”. The dig uncovered pieces of a woolly mammoth’s jawbone, flint tools, Roman coins, Tudor shoes and numerous skeletons All of which raises questions. The spirit of the project is that of an era of London boosterism, when it seemed that this “world city” could only become bigger, richer and more dazzling, and that this direction of travel would without question be magnificent and beneficial to the whole country, an attitude that took a severe knock with Brexit and has received more blows since. The pandemic reduced the attractions of drawing millions into densely populated city centres. If working from home, at least some of the time, is here to stay, a giant people-moving machine might become less essential. Transport for London (TfL) faces a post-Covid-19  funding crisis , inauspicious for the opening of such an ambitious work. The effects of the  Ukrainian conflict  and of  sanctions on Russia , economic and otherwise, remain to be seen. It’s worth asking whether giant projects such as the Elizabeth line are the way of the future. It has cost  £18.25bn , and it is 33 years since it was proposed in its current form in something called the  Central London Railway Study . It can take a generation, in other words, to make something such as this happen. Since we are in a climate emergency, whatever environmental benefits may come from further such splurges on public transport – which incur upfront carbon and energy costs in their construction – may now come too late. Some gurus of mobility argue that driverless electric cars, by using road space efficiently and removing the environmental problems of petrol and diesel, will eventually push urban railways towards obsolescence.

Photograph: © Crossrail Ltd And, given that the government has expressed its belief in levelling up other parts of the country, especially in the Midlands and north, huge investment in London’s already extensive transport infrastructure may seem less compelling now than in the past. “I’m sure it’s a splendid piece of technology,” says John Whitelegg, visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University and an expert in sustainable transport, “but the government told Liverpool it couldn’t have a tram system. How dare we spend £18bn on  Crossrail .” T he essential characteristics of the Crossrail concept are that it is a big, fast train that goes from one side of the capital to the other – a heavy railway placed underground. Its origins go back at least to the 1940s (though some trace it to an idea mooted in the 19th century), when it was proposed as part of the postwar reconstruction of London. The name Crossrail came out of a 1974 study that estimated its cost at £300m. The  1989 Central London Rail Study  developed the concept, and further work was done in the 1990s and 2000s. Still, though, central government balked at paying for it. The financial crisis of 2008 seemed to put the project in jeopardy – how could such expenditure be justified when the government was running out of money? – but an act of parliament was passed and both main parties committed to building it. Contractors were appointed, preliminary works started, land acquired, obstacles – which included the venerable  London Astoria  music venue near Tottenham Court Road – demolished. Crossrail route map Quick Guide Six of the Elizabeth line's star stations, by Rowan Moore Show Paddington The station at Paddington, designed by Weston Williamson, descends in a deep chasm from the former taxi rank alongside Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s famous Victorian terminus. Sturdy columns and large disc-shaped light fittings give a sense of substance and scale. The 120-metre glass canopy above is printed with Cloud Index, a changing image of the sky by the American artist Spencer Finch, which is part of the line’s extensive programme of public art. Bond Street Like most of the Elizabeth line’s central stations, Bond Street comes with significant new development above ground, including a large new commercial building in Hanover Square. Colonnades around the entrances have been designed by the architects John McAslan + Partners to give “a great sense of openness and civic presence”. It has been called the line’s “problem station”, with an increase in budget from £111m to £660m, and its opening will be delayed. Tottenham Court Road The new station exits at one end at the foot of Centre Point, the famous and now-listed 1960s tower. At the other it emerges into the heart of Soho. The architects Hawkins\Brown has given them “daytime” and “night‑time” characters, one bright and airy, the other finished in dark terrazzo. At platform level there is a network of Grimshaw-designed tunnels and passages, luminous and uncluttered. Liverpool Street The length of the Elizabeth line platforms means that those at Liverpool Street reach to the next station on the old underground system, Moorgate. A long subterranean avenue runs from one to the other, with the curving concrete-clad vaults that Grimshaw Architects has designed for several stations. The entrances and exits, by the architects WilkinsonEyre, are animated by shallow fan patterns in concrete and steel. Whitechapel Formerly a cramped and convoluted tube station, Whitechapel is now bridged by an ample new concourse, and oversailed by a swooping roof, which its architects BDP says will help connect communities on either side of the tracks. Like all new Elizabeth line stations, it is wheelchair-accessible to platform level. Some of the details are clunky, but the new station gives new grandeur and dignity to the daily commute. Woolwich The area famous for its old armaments factories, poorly connected until now, is being transformed by the Elizabeth line. A development of 5,000 homes is going up around it, by property company Berkeley Homes, which also helped to build the station and provided the land for it. The architects Weston Williamson has given it a military theme, with strips of regimental colour on its bronze-clad columns Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. In 2012 four pairs of  1,000-tonne, £10m tunnel boring machines , giant mechanical moles with the canteen and toilet facilities of a small ship, started chewing through the subterranean mud. Huge caverns were formed, and 7m tonnes of earth expelled, three-quarters of it to form a new nature reserve at Wallasea Island in Essex. Three-tonne sections of concrete, to make tunnels meant to last at least 120 years, were installed with heft and precision. The route had to be plotted with care, snaking around to avoid the foundations of skyscrapers, sewers and other underground tunnels. The operation had byproducts: it became the largest archaeological dig in Britain, uncovering pieces of a woolly mammoth’s jawbone, flint tools, Roman coins, Tudor shoes, Victorian pickle jars and numerous skeletons, many of them those of plague victims. Community centres were redecorated, a city farm spruced up, a literary festival supported, as part of a programme to support the neighbourhoods where the works took place. Public art, including the mile-plus-long  “Newham wall”  on which the locally raised Sonia Boyce controversially mentioned the murder rate in the area of north Woolwich, was extensively commissioned. It is a rule of construction that time and money, paramount before a project is completed, are rapidly forgotten thereafter The  last time I wrote about Crossrail , in 2013, which involved exploring deep vaults of concrete and clay, I heard confident-going-on-hubristic claims about its delivery within time and its then budget of £14.8bn. “Do not underestimate UK plc’s ability to deliver such projects,” the then Crossrail chief executive Andrew Wolstenholme told me; Britain “has developed a skill set and a reputation second to none”. It didn’t quite work out like that. “We got ourselves into a pickle,” says Mark Wild, who became chief executive in 2018, with the task of sorting things out. The civil engineering – the heavy stuff – had gone well, “a brilliant, brilliant job”, completed in about 2015. But “we got into a muddle” with all the systems that go into it, “the immense density of digitisation”, the “world’s most complex signalling”. It is, though, a common rule of construction that time and money, which seem paramount before a project is completed, are rapidly forgotten thereafter. Few who swipe their cards on the ticket barriers will be much bothered about the difference between nearly £15bn and £18bn-plus, and the four-year delay will be forgotten. What they will see are what Andy Byford, who has been London’s transport commissioner since May 2020, calls “aesthetically stunning” stations. “I think people will be blown away when they see the scale and the very pleasant environments.” Canary Wharf Elizabeth line station.  Photograph: Uyen Luu/Crossrail Ltd There is some history to the design of underground train stations. There are the palatial caverns of Moscow, rococo and neo-classical, ballroom-like, encrusted with sculpture and painting. There are the more restrained structures – such as the chaste rotunda and semi-rotunda that respectively stand over  Arnos Grove  in north London and Chiswick Park in the west – built under the leadership of  Frank Pick , who was chief executive of London Transport in its glory years in the 1930s. These are elegant and considered, with touches of quality in bronze or stone, part of a unified vision of a well-designed public service that also included signs, typefaces, advertising and the famous  London underground map . The Elizabeth line architecture is more in the Frank Pick tradition than Moscow’s. “We’re not being extravagant,” Byford is at pains to say. “We don’t have chandeliers.” Instead you get what they call “line-wide design”, by the engineer Atkins, Grimshaw Architects, the designer Maynard and the lighting designer GIA Equation, whereby seats and fire equipment and all the other paraphernalia of stations are marshalled into a consistent, robust and uncluttered design. Speakers, signs and lights are organised into free-standing “totems”. In the stations that are tunnelled (as opposed to being placed in boxes), the same systems of curving concrete panels are employed throughout. Full-scale mock-ups were built to make sure it would all fit together well. The idea is to be calm and clear, a world away from the muck and rattle of the old tube The effect is luminous. Visual bric-a-brac is kept under control, and advertising is restricted to those places where it will be most noticed; for example, on video screens next to the doors to the trains, which leaves expanses of pale walls, softly uplit, scored by the joints in the concrete and perforated above head height for acoustic reasons. Where one passage joins another the corners are rounded, which will ease the flow of people. It also makes for pleasing shapes where one curve meets another, the concrete folding like handkerchiefs in the wind, of a complexity that would be impossible without digital design and manufacturing. These large pieces of people-plumbing feel smooth and homogeneous, as if formed out of a single substance. The idea is to be calm and clear, a world away from the muck and rattle of the old tube, and to help people find their way around. Given the length of the platforms, a wrong turning by a passenger could result in a long, wasted walk. Then, in the sections that connect to the streets above, the designs become more individual and bespoke, in response to the particularities of the neighbourhood. Ten different architectural practices have designed the 11 stations of the central section, making them a showcase for the more engineering-minded end of British architecture. At Tottenham Court Road, Hawkins\Brown Architects has given different characters to the entrances at the opposite ends of the station: a “nocturnal” connection in dark terrazzo to the fleshpots of Soho, a light and airy “daytime” one at the other end. Weston Williamson, the architect for Woolwich, has designed a disciplined file of sturdy columns, bronze-clad at their base, decorated with strips in the colours of the regiments associated with the area’s historic military facilities. The ceiling at Liverpool Street station.  Photograph: Chris Bevan Lee/Crossrail Ltd The project’s architects like to exploit the drama given to them by the engineering, such as deep plunges down from pavement level at Paddington and Tottenham Court Road. WilkinsonEyre, at Liverpool Street, has conceived a concrete vault that folds like shallow origami, whose triangular patterns are echoed in aluminium panels on the escalator walls. The firm has also made a thing of the crisscross trusses of an office block above the station’s western entrance, which carry the new building over the big open spaces below. These stations feel more orderly and managed than those of the Jubilee line extension, completed in 1999, at the time a bold and famous adventure in architectural commissioning. The  late Will Alsop , who designed the moodily dramatic dark blue North Greenwich station for the Jubilee line, initially worked on Paddington for the Elizabeth line, but the job eventually went to Weston Williamson, also a veteran of the Jubilee line, but more level-headed. Sometimes, in the new stations, calm and consistent translates as bland. A few details, as a result of the ways in which large buildings are now procured and built, clunk. The stations tend to get less convincing where they engage with their messy surroundings at street level, more so when they get close to trains and engineering. But the dominant impressions are of handsomeness and amplitude, expressed in big circular light fittings at Paddington or the high-ceilinged rebuild of the formerly crabby layout of Whitechapel. This composite work of architecture is one to which some people have given the best part of their careers. Julian Robinson, the project’s head of architecture, has been working on it (with breaks to work on the Jubilee line and the London 2012 Olympics) since 1992. Roger Hawkins of Hawkins\Brown tells how his wife gave birth to their son the night after he was interviewed for the Tottenham Court Road commission. The lad will turn 30 next week. One of the project’s most remarkable achievements is its unity and cohesion, given the multiplicity of consultants, contractors, suppliers and commissioning organisations. This is not the work of a single public body but of multiple partnerships with the private sector. The stations at Woolwich and Canary Wharf, for example, were built by the private developers that own the respective sites. S o this queen of tubes, branded in royal purple, will hopefully open in time for its namesake’s  platinum jubilee . The purpose of the architecture is not just vanity, but also to raise the desirability and prestige of public transport, so as encourage people out of cars. The stations will also give a lift to their neighbourhoods – not much needed in Bond Street, perhaps, but helpful in some of the less favoured places touched by the line. The line will, says Byford, be “the ultimate symbol of London’s re-emergence from Covid, a massive morale boost”. Berry says: “A car-free recovery is exactly what we need. It will make a difference to many people’s perceptions.” Wild says: “The asset that we have built is one of this century’s great engineering achievements.”  Byford acknowledges that the pandemic “has driven coach and horses” through TfL’s plans, and is worried about short-term underfunding, which could lead to a “downward spiral” of managed decline, but he says that the business case for the Elizabeth line “is still compelling”. Pre-Covid, the prediction for passenger numbers in 2026 was 250 million. “Now it’s 130-170 million but could be 200 million.” An architect’s image of Bond Street’s significant above-ground development. Described as the project’s ‘problem station’, the Bond Street Elizabeth line station will be delayed.  Photograph: Crossrail Tony Travers, visiting professor at the London School of Economics’s department of government, believes that London will bounce back: “If plague and cholera and the second world war and deindustrialisation didn’t do for London, you have to assume that it will survive.” In which case the Elizabeth line, “whose case was based on the ever-growing density of London”, will be justified. On the question of levelling up, the line’s fans have many answers. One is the amount of work that its construction created nationwide: 75,000 people have worked on Crossrail, says Wild, “the majority of them all over the country”. He cites trains from Derby, vitreous enamel signs from the Isle of Wight, fire doors from Bolton, fibre communications from Ashby de la Zouch. Travers argues that failure to invest in London’s transport would be a case of levelling down, not up. In which case global companies such as Google wouldn’t look to locate in other British cities, but international rivals such as Amsterdam. He points out that most of the funding of the Elizabeth line comes not from central government but from business rates, levies on development and other sources within the capital. Also, that London has large areas of deprivation that are as much in need of levelling up as anywhere else. None of which satisfies Whitelegg. Transport spending per head, he says, citing a  2018 report , is £944 per head per year in London, compared with £314 in the West Midlands. It would be much better to invest in local integrated networks of buses and cycling of a kind that he has worked on in Germany and elsewhere that benefit “more people more immediately at lower cost”. He argues that there is a remarkable lack of evidence for the Elizabeth line’s alleged environmental benefits. Curving concrete panels and free-standing signage ‘totems’ at Tottenham Court Road.  Photograph: Rowan Moore What the Midlands and north have been offered instead is the  HS2  high-speed rail link, costing about £100bn, of  uncertain delivery date  and whose scale makes the Elizabeth line look like a Tri-ang Hornby toy. Meanwhile, London’s  Crossrail 2 , a north-south version of the same idea, has been put on hold.  Travers points out that infrastructure projects are not conceived in conditions of calm objectivity, but reflect such things as the lobbying power of particular cities – in the case of the Elizabeth line, the City of London and an organisation called London First did much to push the project through. The mighty construction industry that builds such projects also has political momentum. What gets built is not theoretically the best solution, but the most likely to be achieved in the circumstances. It is never really possible to know, once it’s built, how a given project would compare with imaginary alternatives. So maybe there is a better, smarter £18bn theoretical transport project than the one that is about to open, that will never be seen. There is good reason to believe that there are better, smarter alternatives to HS2. But, for now, the natural reaction to the Elizabeth line is to be deeply impressed.

4|‘It has to be flawless’: long wait for London’s Elizabeth line is nearly over|2022-02-08|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/it-has-to-be-flawless-long-wait-for-londons-elizabeth-line-is-nearly-over|T he Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief told a press tour on Monday, amid speculation that the £18.9bn  Crossrail  project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. On the first media trip to see the line in action, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street, flaws appeared conspicuously absent. Twelve trains an hour are now running in the central section excavated under the capital, with an official deadline for opening at the end of June. Transport commissioner Andy Byford.  Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said the opening would be “a massive fillip to London’s morale and confidence” after the capital was drained of so much life during the pandemic. “When people arrive, day one, they will be blown away by the scale and by how quiet and smooth the train ride is.” On the concourse below the glass roof of Paddington’s Elizabeth line station, Byford’s words seemed no exaggeration, with trains arriving barely audibly behind the screens sealing the track from the platforms. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said it was “epic, a beautiful outcome”. Most of the volumes of the  newly built stations , such as the control rooms, aren’t even visible, he said: “The Shard would fit in here quite comfortably.” Passenger access to the Elizabeth line.  Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian For passengers, there is little “clutter”, as he puts it: upgraded information screens are above the automatic doors on platforms; all the trains are fully accessible. On board, it is hard to imagine the trains crowded – each carries up to 1,500 people – but they are wide and high enough to contain two rows of straps for any who do stand, and none should have to crick their neck beside a door. The scale is such that to walk to the cab for a driver’s eye view takes a good couple of minutes; at Liverpool Street, where the platform curves into the distance, one end comes out at Moorgate, a whole other stop on the tube till now. The project is in its final  trial operations phase , when volunteers are encouraged to dawdle, block the doors and get in the way, to see how it stands up to routine use. Bigger exercises with 1,000 people are due to be carried out, including staged emergencies ranging from fires to gun attacks – complete with huge cans of soup to simulate, for example, the vomit of a fainting passenger.

Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Bond Street, whose construction fell 18 months behind schedule, has been “clawed back”, said Byford, although it will not open with the rest of the line. It will instead be ready in late 2022, when direct through-trains from the west and east sections that run to Reading or Shenfield respectively will also start running under central London. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Scepticism over Crossrail has grown after previous management promised it was “on time and on budget” until just a few months before the official opening planned for December 2018  was aborted . Now, though, it is tantalisingly close. However, Byford said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “It has to be flawless. Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability,” he said. “Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” Topics London London Underground Transport Transport policy Crossrail The Queen Rail transport features Reuse this content|1
5|Crossrail 2: more than £115m spent before project mothballed|2021-01-18|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/18/crossrail-2-more-than-115m-spent-before-project-mothballed|More than £115m was spent on  Crossrail  2 before work on the scheme for a new north-south rail line through London was suspended in November. The costs for the development and design of the line, which was once hoped to be operational in the early 2030s, were shared between the Department for  Transport  and Transport for London. However,  work was officially paused  as part of the emergency financial agreement between the government and TfL to fund the capital’s transport network after passenger revenues dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic. Around a quarter of the money spent went to Network Rail, the state-owned railway infrastructure manager, according to figures revealed by  New Civil Engineer . The biggest private sector beneficiaries were Arup, whose design consultancy work on the tunnels and southern section totalled almost £12m, and Arcadis, which was paid £11.4m for engineering consultancy. The line would have linked stations in the home counties to the north and south-west of the capital via new tunnels underneath central  London , roughly along the route of the Chelsea-Hackney underground line first discussed in the 1970s. Central development funding was allotted from 2015-16 when construction of the original  Crossrail  line appeared to be on time and on budget, and when Crossrail 2 was  regarded as an essential part of the plan  for handling HS2 passengers arriving in London Euston – a prospect that is in doubt. The division within  TfL  that was working on Crossrail 2 was seconded to other work after Covid-19 hit London last year. TfL said that while the project was mothballed, land would remain safeguarded and the design work would remain relevant. A TfL spokesperson said: “The pandemic, and subsequent impact on our finances, has meant that we have to be realistic about what is currently affordable.” A planned Bakerloo line extension for the underground is also on ice. The spokesperson added: “Our immediate priority for these schemes is progressing safeguarding as they are still likely to be needed in the future to support long-term growth and modal shift in London. The work developing proposals for these schemes will still be used when we are in a position to confirm funding in future.” Topics Crossrail Coronavirus Rail industry TfL Transport Transport policy London Reuse this content|1
6|Crossrail work to continue after £825m government loan|2020-12-01|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/01/crossrail-government-loan-tfl-london-covid|Work to complete  Crossrail  will continue after a last-minute £825m loan to London from the government kept the delayed rail line from a “disastrous” mothballing. Transport for London said the new financing would allow work to carry on “at pace” to open the new railway in 2022 – but the political row simmered on between the mayor and ministers over whether the capital was being unfairly treated in the coronavirus pandemic. Crossrail  announced in August that it would require more funds  after putting back its opening date a further year from 2021, partly due to distancing requirements for safe working. The  London  mayor, Sadiq Khan, said that ministers had insisted London pay the shortfall on the £18.7bn project, a joint venture between TfL and the national government, “despite the overwhelming majority of the tax income that will result from Crossrail going to the Treasury”. Khan said: “This is another example of London supporting the country way over and above the help we get from this government. I do not want this project to be stalled so it is vital that we dig deep to get the railway up and running.” The government agreed  £1.8bn of emergency Covid-19 financing  for TfL last month to help tackle the huge loss in revenues since passengers were told to avoid travel, but excluded Crossrail funding at the time. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “The government remains committed to the rapid completion of the project, in a way that is fair to UK taxpayers, and has committed to financing the completion of Crossrail. However, London – as the primary beneficiary – must ultimately bear any additional costs.” He added that the government would “take all necessary steps to complete the project without requiring further additional funding”, while TfL was commissioning further independent analysis of costs. Huge problems with the construction of stations along the new railway under central London were revealed only  months before its original planned December 2018 opening , followed by difficulties in harmonising an overly complex signalling system. Speaking to the London assembly transport committee after the announcement, Andy Byford, the TfL commissioner, said there would be “no further slippage” and that he and Crossrail had “a very clear understanding of the work still to do”. Byford said that the funding deal “came down to the wire” and that no agreement “would have been disastrous: we would have had to mothball the project – it was grim reality, we would have had to stop work, we would have had no financial authority”. With the money, he said: “We will be pragmatic, we may choose to park a few things - none safety critical, none public facing – to get the railway open. I’m crystal clear: no further slippage, no further recourse to public funding over and above what was previously identified by the outgoing Crossrail board.” The outgoing board had identified a £1.1bn budget overrun and the deputy London mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, admitted the government might still be asked to fund the remaining £275m. She said the delayed opening would also increase TfL’s losses by £200m, to a total of £1.3bn, in budgeted revenues from the Elizabeth line (as Crossrail will be known). The current deal will see the Greater London Authority borrow up to £825m from the Department for Transport, to pass on as a grant to TfL. The GLA will repay the loan from business rate supplements and levies on developers. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said delivery of the Elizabeth line was “in its complex final stages”, with more work to do on building the infrastructure before a year of intensive testing of the system could start in 2021. The Elizabeth line, capable of moving more than half a million passengers daily, would boost the UK economy by £42bn, according to TfL.

7|"Crossrail is a memorial to another London – one that expected to prosper for ever | Ian Jack"|2021-01-11|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/crossrail-london-prosper-elizabeth-line-brexit-covid|"I n the tangle of west London’s railway junctions – out Willesden way, where trains creak around tight curves, attempting to circumvent the  London  termini – I recently came across lines of new carriages waiting for work. I think it was at that famous railway placename Old Oak Common, where the smoke from the locomotive sheds once lay black across the sky. Several long sidings were filled with them: new, in a livery of shining white, with the London  Transport  roundel emblazoned on their sides – in purple and crossed with the words ELIZABETH LINE. The sight gave me a stab of longing for a time of greater certainty, pre-Brexit and pre-Covid, when the most problematic aspect of London’s future, the levels of inequality among the population apart, was its apparently unstoppable growth. In the  words of a report  published by Oxford Economics, the city’s economy was “growing strongly, easily outpacing both the UK and its nearest European rivals such as Paris and Frankfurt”. What the report called “significant investments” in public infrastructure, office buildings, retail, and flats and houses pointed to a widespread optimism that the growth would continue “not just for the next year or two but for many years to come”. The report wondered how confident London should be about its growth trajectory – how a crisis in the eurozone or the possibility of the UK’s departure from the EU might affect it – but the answer seemed to be: pretty confident, all things considered. That was in March 2016. Crossrail , which the Queen renamed after herself the previous month, is the largest of these public investments. The east-west link across the capital was first proposed in the 1940s. Construction began in 2009 with a promised finishing date of 2018 for the line’s 73 miles, which in 2018 was put back to 2019 and now, after further postponements, is forecast to be  early 2022 .  It has been a grand project.  Thirteen miles of twin tunnels  were bored under the city and 8m tonnes of earth removed, most of it to  Wallasea Island  in Essex, where it forms the foundations of a nature reserve. Its trains are, or were, expected to carry 200 million passengers a year, simplifying and quickening their previous journeys and relieving overcrowding on other lines. Its estimated cost has predictably risen, from  £15.9bn to £18.25bn , and over the next two years may rise further; but in 2022, all being well, a traveller from the City of London will reach Heathrow in 33 minutes, and with any luck have a seat all the way. For the present, the most the commuter can do is travel by new trains on the old routes from Berkshire and Essex to Paddington and Liverpool Street. The tunnels that connect the two terminals can be experienced only  in photographs . Pristine, beautifully lit, populated only by a few engineers in hard hats and smart orange overalls, their curved emptiness suggests a memorial. If the future obeys conventional wisdom and the commuting habit begins to die – with workers working onscreen at home, or in cheaper offices in the outer suburbs, or coming into the city less regularly, off-peak and two days a week rather than five – then these tunnels might come to mark the turning point of a tide in human traffic that has been rising since railways first reached London in the late 1830s – rising and widening, so that people are sucked every morning from quite distant towns and cities (Weymouth, Norwich, Grantham, Bath) to serve the metropolitan economy. Of course, conventional wisdom could be wrong, and London could go back to business as usual. I look most days at the windows of estate agents in our London high street, and expect to see the prices fall, as ordinary sense suggests they would. But they never do; perhaps prices are sustained by the fall in sterling’s value, making property cheaper for the foreign speculator. The Elizabeth line might keep up a similar appearance of success, not by expanding the market but by stealing commuters from other routes, leaving them half-empty and vulnerable to the axe. Bad luck or poor timing can spoil the best-laid scheme. Some projects, conveniently for their supporters, become too late to stop. “That ship has sailed” has become the justification for HS2, just as it was in the 1960s when an incoming Labour government looked as if it might cancel the Polaris nuclear submarine programme, as promised in the manifesto. The Admiralty  told Harold Wilson  that construction of the first two submarines had “passed the point of no return”, so Wilson’s administration went on to complete them and a further two; in this murk, the huge and continuing expense of Britain’s “independent nuclear deterrent” was born. Other projects succeed despite their birth in the late afternoon of optimism, just before sunset and a chilly dusk. When in 1911 Britain decided to  move its Indian capital  from Kolkata to New Delhi it imagined that sunset would never come. George V laid the foundation stone; the leading English architects  Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker  were appointed; and over the next 20 years a majestic imperial headquarters was created, at considerable and often criticised expense. It was, from the British point of view, a folly: when the new city was eventually inaugurated, British rule had only 16 years left to run. Independent India, on the other hand, inherited a capital that had been barely worn, a planned city whose broad avenues and handsome architecture made it among the most attractive in the world. That was a good outcome. There is another kind. Growing up in postwar industrial Scotland I often met  Ozymandias , in the shape of ruins created by an excess of confidence 50 years before. Ozy could be encountered in all kinds of locations, but perhaps most memorably in the west end of Glasgow, among the stone terraces and villas of the city’s bourgeoisie, where several abandoned stations marked the Caledonian Railway’s attempt in the late 1890s to woo the rich commuter. The best Scottish architects had been hired –  James Miller and JJ Burnet  were the able counterparts of Lutyens and Baker – to produce extravagant buildings that ranged in style from “English domestic” to Muscovite cathedral. Their trade destroyed by the coming of the electric tram, most of these stations had put up their shutters by 1940, though the buildings survived long after. In the 1960s it was still a delight to turn a corner in Glasgow and come across what seemed to be the Kremlin. In the Edwardian age, the same railway opened a 40-mile line from the city’s eastern edge all the way to the Ayrshire port of Ardrossan, paralleling the older line of a rival company for most of the way. This was confidence bordering on madness; cars were already kicking up the dust of Scottish roads. But the Caledonian believed the new line would cure a problem of capacity at Glasgow docks; coal for export from the Lanarkshire mines would be shipped from Ardrossan instead. And so embankments were made, cuttings dug, stations and viaducts built, double track laid, and telegraph wire strung from post to post: all in the assumption that the Lanarkshire collieries had near-inexhaustible reserves of coal and that no new Glasgow docks would be built, assumptions that proved false. It closed after 30 years, by which time the Caledonian company itself was a memory. I imagine that at its opening some local aristocrat spoke about how the district would “prosper mightily” – the new  Johnson mantra . Like a lot of things our prime minister says, the words belong in the mouth of a man in a top hat as he cuts a ribbon – a man who, if truth be told, hasn’t the faintest idea of what comes next.

8|Crossrail 2 plans shelved as part of £1.8bn TfL funding deal|2020-11-02|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/02/crossrail-2-plans-shelved-transport-for-london-funding-deal|Plans to build Crossrail 2 will be shelved as part of the  £1.8bn bailout deal  agreed by the government and Transport for London at the weekend. TfL will also have to further investigate driverless trains under the terms of the deal to provide emergency funds to the capital, which has lost billions in passenger revenue because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The details of the six-month agreement, contained in a letter from the transport secretary,  Grant Shapps , to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, force TfL to end spending on Crossrail 2. Transport for London secures £1.8bn government bailout Read more The new north-south line across the capital was described by the national infrastructure commission in 2016  as a national priority , and a department set up within TfL under Michèle Dix as managing director to drive it forward. Staff have already been seconded to other projects, it is understood. While it had been previously hoped that construction could start in the early 2020s, Crossrail 2, costing an estimated £33bn, became a  focus for anger  at the imbalance on spending on transport infrastructure between the south-east and other regions, and  lost its main champions  in the government after the EU referendum. Now the Department for  Transport  has demanded that TfL “brings an orderly end to consultancy work as soon as possible”, although it has agreed to continue to safeguard land, allowing the scheme to be potentially revived in the future. Discussions are continuing over providing more funding to the original Crossrail, which has  blown its enlarged £18bn budget  and is expected to open in 2022. TfL has also agreed to work with the government on a politically contentious study into implementing driverless trains. While technically possible – Docklands Light Railway trains are automated – TfL believes it represents poor value for money. A  leaked internal report  suggested converting the underground system and trains would require an initial capital outlay of £7bn. Nonetheless, the Shapps letter commits TfL to “work with a government-led expert review on the possible implementation of driverless trains”. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has long pushed the idea, not least during his clashes with unions during his time as mayor. The row over the bailout has been bitter, as Khan contrasted the money spent on rescuing national rail firms during the coronavirus crisis with the conditions placed on TfL, and accused Johnson of lying over the state of the capital’s finances. The government has not insisted on an  extension of the congestion charging zone , as had been signalled, nor on general fare increases. However, the increased £15 daily fee and extended hours of operation of the congestion charge will remain in place, as will limitations on free over-60s travel. Discussions will continue on longer-term funding, with  TfL keen to secure a settlement  that makes it less reliant on fare income and matches other world cities. A TfL spokesperson said: “Although we have started to utilise the skills of the  Crossrail  2 team on other business critical projects, the team continues to support the work of refreshing the 2015 safeguarding directions in order to protect the route from future development. This will ensure that the crucial infrastructure can be delivered at a time when a long-term sustainable funding model is in place.”  This article was amended on 3 November 2020 because Docklands Light Railway trains are partially automated, not fully automated as an earlier version said.

9|Crossrail delayed again until 2022 and another £450m over budget|2020-08-21|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/21/crossrail-delayed-again-until-2022-and-another-450m-over-budget-tfl-covid-19|Crossrail, the mass-transit train line through London, has been further delayed until 2022 and gone another £450m over budget. Transport for London said that the temporary pause in construction and ensuing slowdown because of Covid-19 distancing requirements had only partially contributed to the latest delays, which mean the Elizabeth line will open more than three years late and cost almost £4bn more than originally budgeted. The announcement follows a Crossrail board meeting, which concluded that any 2021 opening date was an unrealistic target, only a month after it ruled out opening next summer. Crossrail said it was working to finalise the cost estimates and the exact budget remains unclear, with additional Network Rail costs due to be factored in, but that it was at least £450m more than the  estimated range in November 2019 , which would make the current expected budget up to £18.7bn. Timeline Crossrail - two decades of delays and rising costs Show November 2000   The study into the possible London East West route is published. January 2002   Cross London Rail Links Limited is set up as a joint venture between the Strategic Rail Authority and Transport for London (TFL). 27 October 2003     -     3 December 2003   Public consultation on the preferred route is held. June 2004   The government announces the go-ahead for Crossrail. July 2008   Four years later, and after further public consultation, the Crossrail Hybrid Bill finally passes through parliament. May 2009   Construction starts. January 2014   National Audit Office declares that the Crossrail programme is on schedule. March 2014   The extension of the route to Reading is announced. May 2015   Tunnelling work is declared finished. TFL takes over the running of the Liverpool Street to Shenfield mainline services which will form the eastern part of the route. February 2016   It is announced that the route will officially be called the Elizabeth Line when it opens. May 2017   The first tests of the new trains are delayed. June 2017   The first of the new trains enter service between Liverpool Street and Shenfield. 24 January 2018   Crossrail is forced to reveal that it is running 20% over budget, but says it will still open by the end of the year. May 2018   Tfl starts running services from Paddington to Heathrow, which will form part of the western end of the final Crossrail service. July 2018   Government approves additional funding, increasing the total budget from £14.8bn to £15.4bn. August 2018   Crossrail announces that there will be a year delay in opening, with services through the tunnelled London section expected to open in autumn 2019. 8 November 2019   Further delays and a rise in costs to £18bn are announced - with the aim for Crossrail to open “as soon as practically possible in 2021”. 21 August 2020   Yet another delay is announced , as TfL say a temporary pause in construction and ensuing slowdown due to Covid-19 distancing requirements has only partially contributed to another cost overrun of £450m. The line will not now open before 2022. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The giant infrastructure scheme had been planned to cost £14.8bn, with services across the heart of London to start operating in December 2018, but the problems in its delivery were  formally admitted only months before the planned opening  by the Queen was due to take place. Crossrail’s chief executive, Mark Wild, said: “Our focus remains on opening the Elizabeth line as soon as possible. Now more than ever Londoners are relying on the capacity and connectivity that the Elizabeth line will bring and we are doing everything possible to deliver the railway as safely and quickly as we can.” While delivery of the Elizabeth line was in its complex final stages, according to a Crossrail statement, the project was being completed at a time of great uncertainty because of the risk of more coronavirus outbreaks. Crossrail admitted that construction had been slow, with “lower than planned productivity in the final completion and handover of the shafts and portals” of the line. It said it had also overestimated the speed at which it could finish and hand over the  new stations built in central London . Covid-19 had exacerbated schedule pressures, it said, with constraints on how many people could work on site, currently reducing numbers by half to about 2,000 workers. The business group London First described the delay as “disappointing but unsurprising” and said it should “not distract from the need for a fair and sustainable long-term funding solution for TfL”. Crossrail hopes to start intensive testing of train services, or trial running, as soon as possible in 2021. Bond Street station remains incomplete and not ready to be part of the tests. The scheme, when completed, is designed to carry up to 200 million passengers a year across the capital from beyond the far west of London to eastern suburbs. As well as relieving London’s normally congested tube system, it will eventually provide fast, direct links between Heathrow airport and Reading to central London, the financial districts, with branches to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. The central underground section has been the major work, with 13 miles of new tunnels from Paddington to Abbey Wood. However, even when it finally opens, Crossrail has not squared when it can join up with the other two parts of the Elizabeth line, which have different signalling systems and already operate services on existing, overground rail lines. For an unspecified period, passengers wishing to travel from the western end, from Reading and Heathrow, will have to change at the Paddington mainline station to join Elizabeth line services for central London and passengers on the eastern branch to Shenfield will have to change trains at Liverpool Street.

10|Government to finally drop plan for HS2 link to Leeds – reports|2021-11-14|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/14/government-to-finally-drop-plan-for-hs2-link-to-leeds-reports|The government has refused to confirm or deny reports that it will finally  cancel plans for the HS2 link to Leeds  this week, and instead fund a hodgepodge of disparate projects which favour Conservative constituencies and leave mysterious gaps in the rail network. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is expected to announce the outcome of the long-delayed integrated rail plan on Thursday. The Sunday Times suggested  he would commit to building HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester but not Leeds, which has earmarked a large part of the city centre to accommodate a new station. To soften the blow, Shapps is expected to announce two shorter high-speed routes, the paper said. One would run between Leeds and Sheffield and another from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, which is in the Conservative constituency of Rushcliffe, 10 miles south of Nottingham. There would apparently be a  puzzling non high-speed gap  of 50 miles between the two new lines. According to the Mail on Sunday,  Leeds  will receive its own tram system “in consolation” for not being connected to HS2. The director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, Henri Murison, said: “Without the benefits to areas such as Yorkshire and the north-east, HS2’s status as a project to drive the whole of the UK is undermined considerably. “Will this be a government that levels up, or levels down and walks away from the northern powerhouse they promised with city leaders across the north?” Behind the scenes in the northern mayoralties, there are also major jitters about Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), a new trans-Pennine railway line from Liverpool to Leeds via Bradford. Details about the line were conspicuously absent from Sunday’s newspaper leaks, though building it was one of Boris Johnson’s first pledges as prime minister. Three days into the job in 2019, he  gave a speech  at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum, saying: “I want to be the prime minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London.” He  committed in February 2020 to bringing HS2 to the north of England , building “a rapid connection from the West Midlands to the northern powerhouse, to Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds”. Crossrail is a new £18.6bn east-west rail line in London. It is currently three years behind schedule and £3.8bn over budget, but seen as a key driver of economic growth in the capital. NPR is the brainchild of Transport for the North (TfN) , a statutory body set up to advise ministers on the region’s transport needs.  It says NPR  would reduce road usage by 58,000 car trips per day, and create 100,000 jobs in the urban north. TfN has been adamant the line should include a new through-station in Bradford, which was  named last week as Britain’s worst-connected major city.   The Mail on Sunday said other announcements expected this week included the £78m electrification of the line from Wigan to Bolton, which now has two Tory MPs, and a reinstatement of a passenger service from Sheffield to Stocksbridge, which in 2019 elected its first Tory MP since 1935. Murison said the government’s priority should be to build HS2 south from Leeds “as well as securing a new station in Bradford on the critical new line across the Pennines”. HS2 protesters Swampy and Satchel leave Wendover tunnel after 35 days Read more The Guardian asked TfN what the point of its existence was, if the government ignored its key recommendations. Its chief executive, Martin Tugwell, said it would be premature to comment before Thursday. “What does remain clear though, is our commitment to securing the best possible rail connectivity for the 15.2 million people of the North, and fundamental to that connectivity is the work we have done to date on Northern Powerhouse Rail as a co-client with government and the way it integrates with the rest of the rail network, including with HS2,” he said. A Department for  Transport  spokesperson said: “Work is continuing on the integrated rail plan. We will publish it shortly and do not comment on speculation.” Topics North of England HS2 Rail transport Transport Leeds news Reuse this content|1
11|London Underground’s Northern line extension comes into service|2021-09-20|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/20/london-undergrounds-northern-line-extension-comes-into-service|The first major addition to the  London  Underground this century comes into service on Monday, when the Northern line extension opens to carry passengers to new stops at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station. Taking six years of construction and testing, and a longer period again of design and planning, the £1.1bn project – adding nearly two miles of tunnel as well as the two stations – has put the dramatically changing area of south London on the Tube map. The first trains were due to run from 5.28am, signalling what  Transport  for London hopes will be a landmark moment in the recovery from the pandemic. About 25,000 new jobs and more than 20,000 new homes will have resulted from the investment, according to TfL, with Battersea now a 15-minute direct ride from the West End. Work has come in under budget and only a year behind schedule, including a pause due to Covid. Approved and launched in 2014, following decades of growing use of public transport in the capital and the population confidently forecast to increase, the extension has opened at a time of much greater uncertainty. Eight million passengers a year could eventually use the line. But weekday Tube journeys are now roughly half of pre-pandemic levels, with the lost revenue hammering London’s finances.  TfL  hopes to restore 80% of its former passenger numbers by 2023 to balance the books. The extension, the first since the Jubilee line stretched eastwards in 1999, could allow the long-entangled Northern line to split into two separate lines, engineers suggest. For now, trains to Battersea will run from all the northern branches, with services on the new extension every 10-12 minutes, doubling in frequency next year.

The regeneration has been  questioned for its impact  on the landscape and the communities, with numerous properties sold to super-rich foreign investors while other residents occupy “poor-door” housing schemes. TfL said Nine Elms station could have 479 new rental homes built above and around it, 40% of which will be categorised as affordable. Battersea Power Station station, the only London stop to be named “station” twice, will fittingly look better than most: featuring a gold-painted geometric roof with a giant skylight and an imposing ticket hall fitted out with artwork by London-based Brazilian artist Alexandre da Cunha. The restored power station will open in 2022 as an enormous retail, entertainment and office complex, housing hundreds of multimillion-pound luxury apartments, five years after its four famous 51-metre-high chimneys were painstakingly reconstructed in concrete. London still awaits its biggest addition to the transport network, the £19bn  Crossrail  scheme which will open in full as the Elizabeth line in 2022, more than  three years behind schedule . However, the changing patterns of commuting accelerated by the pandemic, along with the hole in TfL’s finances and the government’s stated aim of “levelling up” investment nationwide, mean that is likely to be the last extension to the network for some time. Plans to extend the Bakerloo line and build  Crossrail 2 have been shelved .  This article was amended on 23 September 2021, removing an incorrect mention of a direct ride from the City to Battersea.

12|Andy Byford: ‘We can’t let London’s transport fall into managed decline’|2021-11-20|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/20/andy-byford-we-cant-let-londons-transport-fall-into-managed-decline|H is overriding preoccupation is the trains under  London , but Andy Byford’s passion could have led him on a quite different journey. “I thought long and hard about going in the navy when I was younger,” says London’s transport commissioner. “I like being at sea.” Instead, the young Byford pulled on the uniform of  London Underground , eventually coming full circle, via Australia, Canada and the US, to the top job at Transport for London – where a huge Royal Navy and Plymouth flag now adorns the wall of his Southwark office. Few of his staff have seen it in real life, as Byford was installed last June with the pandemic in full cry. “It’s been surreal. I only met one of my execs in person, and my board members for the first time the other day. I’ve been running London’s transport system on Teams.” While life for many is looking more normal, Byford’s outlook is not rosy. Unless investment is agreed with government, he warns, London is “staring into the abyss”, after the calamitous impact of Covid on fare revenue and finances. “Without wanting to be too grandiose, we are at a crossroads,” he says. “We can go one of two ways: an infrastructure-led recovery that creates jobs and decarbonises transport.” Profile Andy Byford CV Show Executive summary Age  56 Family  Married for 27 years, to a colleague he met working on the tube. Education  BA in French and German from Leicester University; diploma in transport from the University of London. Pay  £355,000 – the same as his two predecessors. Eligible for a bonus of up to 50%, but has not taken one. Last holiday  Not gone abroad since he joined TfL. Spent a week at home in Plymouth in September; “I still did my Crossrail calls.” Best advice he’s been given  “Stick to your principles, and be honest in your dealings with other people and honest to yourself. From a boss in Australia years back.” Biggest career mistake  “In Toronto, I got caught up in the politics around a controversial subway extension and was accused of being disingenuous, which I wasn’t – it rankles with me to this day.” Word he overuses  “Compelling.” How he relaxes  “Watching football, jogging, looking out to sea watching the warships go by. And spending time with my wife: she’s my absolute best friend.” Photograph: Nakita Krucker/Toronto Star Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Or, he says: “The negative route, the danger we face, is a managed decline. A sustained bleak future for London’s transport system, in which you can look forward to roads full of potholes, much wider gaps in train and bus services, and a complete grinding to a halt of the clean-air agenda.” Maintenance will suffer; plans to electrify buses will go, as will cycling routes. Without backing, London will see “a complete regression to the bad old days”. Byford knows what that looks like: he started out as a station foreman, working shifts as a graduate trainee in the late 1980s, when the capital’s transport system was still at a nadir, its dirt and danger underscored by the King’s Cross fire that killed 37 people. He recently experienced again where underinvestment leads: “Having lived in New York and been president of New York transit, I don’t want to go there.” He ran the city’s transport authority from 2017 before  resigning last year  after clashes with governor Andrew Cuomo. Byford was apparently a recognisable, popular figure in New York, dubbed “Train Daddy”, out and about on the system he was trying to overhaul. He rarely used the private driver that came with his job and took the subway instead, wearing his name badge. London colleagues say he rarely walks past an employee, from cleaners to gate staff, without an introduction and question about what could work better – that he is affable but intensely focused. In New York, his goal was modernising the subway, whose track, signalling and stations were in a “dreadful state of repair”, he says: “That’s what London has ahead of it. It’s very easy to stop investing and slash services – it’s a long road back to rectify it.” Byford in his days running the Toronto subway.  Photograph: Nakita Krucker/Toronto Star/Getty Images Rishi Sunak’s spending review was “crushingly disappointing” for Transport for London, he says. “We have a looming, major hole in our capital budget.” Funding from central government expires on 11 December; the last emergency deal was agreed, he says, literally “at 14 minutes to midnight”. New discussions are yet to start but signs are there will be very limited support. The government’s standoff with London appears to owe much to antipathy to the mayor, Sadiq Khan, with ministers questioning his financial management. Byford asserts: “I don’t get involved with the politics. I stick to stark facts.  TfL  was in a very strong position financially before the pandemic – that cash reserve kept us going.” For someone who eschews politics, Byford has a slick, but earnest, pitch: “Don’t see us as a cost problem but a solution.” He stresses he is “very grateful” for government support and backs “ levelling up ”, but adds: “London is the economic engine of the UK – it can only fire up and continue providing £38bn net to the exchequer by having a viable transport system.” Investment would allow London to buy electric buses from Ballymena, Piccadilly line trains made in Goole: “Let us partner and we can help.” When Crossrail opens, people will be blown away. It’s quiet, smooth, fully accessible. It’s spectacular. Andy Byford With Tube ridership plateauing at 60-70% of pre-pandemic levels, TfL wants another £1.7bn to help cover lost revenue and operating costs until March 2023, from when, “with very onerous cost-cutting, we will get back to financial sustainability – a massive task”. Beyond the finances, Byford’s focus is Crossrail. Perception of the £19bn project turned swiftly in 2018, when its former executives’ proud boasts of delivering on time and on budget proved hollow. Byford, though, has attuned himself unsparingly to the present reality, committing to not letting costs or the  mid-2022 opening date  slide further. He schedules an 8am meeting with the Crossrail chief executive, Mark Wild, and other top staff daily. “I literally have a call every single day, including weekends, bank holidays, when I’m on leave. The second face I see after my wife’s every morning is Mark Wild’s.” Right now, Crossrail’s stations are almost all done, with trial running of trains under way and trial operations - “playing trains, practising scenarios such as mass evacuations, escalator failures, fires” - imminent. He is pushing his team and suppliers to beat the schedule, but won’t specify a date yet. Above all, he says, “it’s got to be reliable. I do not want a Heathrow T5 scenario”, where the airport terminal’s systems failed on day one. “When it opens, it will be the envy of the world. People will be blown away. It’s quiet, smooth, fully accessible. It’s spectacular.” London will owe him thanks if it opens soon – although Byford, who failed his driving test twice and has never owned a car, will want to ride regardless: “I like using public transport. It’s a badge of honour for me.” Topics TfL Observer business profile London London Underground Rail transport interviews Reuse this content|1
13|Monday briefing: Thousands of homes being built in flood zones|2021-11-22|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/22/monday-briefing-flood-zones|Top story: ‘Protections must be put in place’ Hello, I’m Warren Murray and this is the briefing, all of a Monday morning. More than 5,000 new homes in flood-risk areas of England have been granted planning permission so far this year. Insurers said they were concerned about the numbers of homes being built where owners were at risk of experiencing “traumatic and devastating losses”. But builders say the housing shortage means  even flood-risk areas have to be used  – and the climate crisis means more defences and mitigation measures need to be put in place. An investigation by Greenpeace this year found that one-third of England’s most important flood defences were in private hands, with more than 1,000 in a poor state of repair. The government said it was investing over £5.2bn in flood and coastal defences in England, which would improve protection for more than 336,000 properties. “Our national planning policy is clear that floodplain development should be avoided wherever possible, and protections must be put in place when building in these areas is necessary – we expect local planning authorities to follow this guidance.” Car ploughs into Christmas parade –  At least five people have been killed after a vehicle was driven at speed through a Christmas parade in a town in Wisconsin, police have confirmed. A red sport utility vehicle ploughed into marchers in Waukesha about 20 miles west of Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon,  also injuring more than 40 people . 01:20 Social media footage shows SUV speeding through Wisconsin Christmas parade – video Police had opened fire on the vehicle in order to try to stop it, said the town’s police chief, Dan Thompson. One person of interest was in custody, he said, and the vehicle involved had been recovered. Johnson, Starmer woo CBI –  Boris Johnson is to announce that all new buildings in England will have to  install electric vehicle charge points from 2022.  In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) today, the PM is due to say that the government expects it to lead to 145,000 new charging points each year. The government will also support a loan programme worth £150m to help British small and medium enterprises, including green businesses, commercialise their research. Keir Starmer will tell the CBI a Labour government would not “throw cash at” the country’s problems. Starmer will aim to woo a sector that  Labour believes has been alienated by Johnson’s government . Labour has attacked the government for wasting billions of pounds on “crony Covid contracts”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour would set up an “office for value for money”. Labour has made significant spending pledges, though, including £28bn of green investment each year until the end of the decade. Isis suspects buy freedom –  Suspected Isis members are  buying their way out jail in north-east Syria for the equivalent of £6,000 each , according to interviews with two freed men and official documents. As part of the deal, they sign a declaration promising not to rejoin any armed organisations and to leave the parts of north and east Syria under control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). About 10,000 such men are held in three overcrowded SDF-administered prisons in north-east Syria. David Haines was murdered by members of an Islamic State terror cell in 2014.  Photograph: Family handout/PA Separately, Bethany Haines –  whose father, David Haines was captured by Isis in Syria and beheaded  – has described watching the video of his murder and looking an alleged Islamic State killer in the eye in court. In the programme The Isis ‘Beatles’: Blood On Their Hands, to be broadcast on ITV today, Bethany tells of flying out to see El Shafee Elsheikh appear in court. He is charged over the beheading of four US hostages but not her father’s murder. “He just stared right into my eyes and I stared back. I’m not going to be intimidated by him. I’m not going to look away.” Crossrail at turning point –  Hopes that Crossrail will open in central London in early 2022 – this time on schedule – have been boosted as the troubled £19bn scheme  moved into its final phase of testing at the weekend . The trial operations phase will comprise more than 150 exercises over three to six months, involving thousands of volunteer passengers, to ensure that the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, is ready for full passenger service and can cope with emergency situations. TfL bosses have committed to open the line in full in the first half of next year. Initially, passengers will need to change trains between the new central underground section and the services already running from Reading in the west and Shenfield in the east, but TfL hopes some trains could run from suburbs across the city centre by next autumn, ahead of a May 2023 deadline. A dill –  A “mortified” Australian TV reporter has tried to explain how he bungled an exclusive interview with Adele about her new album, 30, because he hadn’t actually listened to it. Matt Doran and a crew flew to London for the chat, which reportedly cost A$1m to secure and would have been Adele’s only Australian interview. After Doran conceded during the interview that  he had only heard one track from her latest work, 30 , the interview was canned. Doran said he missed the email that contained a preview of the album.

14|As commuters take to their cars, Crossrail can ill afford this new delay|2020-08-23|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/23/as-commuters-take-to-their-cars-crossrail-can-ill-afford-this-new-delay|W hether by accident or design, there was a grim irony in the timing of Crossrail’s  latest admission of overspend and delay : it was declared just minutes after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had taken to the Friday morning airwaves to herald a new “acceleration unit”, designed to get infrastructure projects more quickly to fruition. Crossrail was for years billed as Europe’s biggest infrastructure project, in the days when executives would boast that it was being delivered on time and on budget – until, just before the finishing line, they conceded that it absolutely wasn’t. The additional requirements have now reached an extra £4bn and four years to get London’s east-west Elizabeth line up and running, hopefully at some point in 2022. The sums compound the problems for the capital, in a year when fare income has all but disappeared thanks to Covid-19, and the mayor and Transport for  London  (TfL) have had to rely on an antagonistic central government to provide emergency funding. At least the pandemic provides some cover for the Crossrail board: Covid-19 restrictions have masked failings in construction and management, and the business plan that relied on anticipated Crossrail revenues to fund a fares freeze was already obliterated. And as Crossrail remains the joint responsibility of both the Department for Transport and City Hall, ministers can hardly seek to use it to further tighten the screws on  TfL . Indeed, even the £1.6bn TfL bailout and the Crossrail overspend combined will soon be surpassed by the extra money the Treasury has found to subsidise train companies in order to keep the national railway running in this extraordinary year. The bill to run the railway could rise further: many are urging a fares freeze after an unexpectedly high RPI inflation rate last week signalled a  1.6% rise in ticket prices in January . Annual rail fare increases have outstripped wage rises in normal times; now, with cuts the order of the day at many employers, another increase looks politically toxic. More importantly, the railway urgently needs to get people back on the trains, lest the current trend for avoidance – passenger numbers are less than a quarter of pre-pandemic levels – becomes entrenched. Serious questions would then have to be asked about rail investment: both the operating subsidy and the schemes now in the planning. What comes of Shapps’s latest wheeze, the DfT acceleration unit, remains to be seen. But its mandate is said to cover both road and rail, and it was launched on the day that Highways England published its plans to spend £27bn on roads. Given the long gestation of some of those designs – the Thames Crossing, the trans-Pennine upgrade and the Stonehenge tunnel – it could well be road building that a minister might wish to accelerate. With Treasury purse strings loosened as never before, both rail and road projects are currently in favour, but sooner or later, hard choices are likely to be made. HS2 has the formal go-ahead, but its north-east branch is far from nailed on. The Stonehaven rail tragedy earlier this month could lead to fresh costs to  guarantee existing lines’ safety in the face of more extreme weather . Network Rail’s debt, in a sign of the true expense of rail engineering, has quietly ballooned. Crossrail is too far advanced to be shelved. But until it is operational, it will be a potent symbol of profligacy and broken promises – and at a time when people are taking to their cars rather than trains and London’s offices lie empty. Those who champion public transport over road building and wish for a green recovery dearly need the Elizabeth line to be completed without further delay. Can the blockbuster strike back? Christopher Nolan’s films are known for their plot twists but his latest,  Tenet , will reveal the answer to the biggest unknown question of all – whether film fans are ready to flood back to cinemas. Nolan’s film, which opens nationally on Wednesday, is the  first Hollywood blockbuster to be released since March , making it the litmus test for the popularity of socially distanced, mask-wearing cinemagoing. Cinema owners say pre-sales suggest it is going to be a hit, and they need it to be. Last week’s top 10 films in cinemas in the UK and Ireland – which, devoid of major new releases, included  Jurassic Park  and Nolan’s decade-old  Inception  – made just over £800,000. A typical week last year would have seen a box-office take of about £24m. However, even if attendance levels return to normal, the pandemic has introduced a much greater threat to traditional moviegoing than the closure of theatres for a few months. The shutdown has given studios the unique opportunity to test the future by making films immediately available to streaming services –a direct threat to the sacrosanct model which has allowed cinemas to enjoy exclusivity for up to 90 days. The most seismic move has been made by Disney – beloved of cinema owners for its solid-gold pipeline of billion-dollar hits year after year – which is  making  Mulan  available on its Disney+ service . At $42bn annually, the global box office is too valuable for this digital-first toe-in-the-water strategy to mark the end of the big-screen blockbuster. Studios are still keeping their biggest releases for cinema premiere. But for some smaller films, digital-first may prove more profitable for studios. The balance of power has shifted and the iron grip cinema owners have enjoyed over movie content for generations has been broken in the Netflix era. Trump could yet hold key to developing-world debt crisis In 2005, when the wealthy nations of the world descended on Gleneagles to agree a £30bn debt write-off for developing-world countries, the global economy was on a high. The G8 nations were growing and they felt flush. When trouble hit in 2008, it was the Chinese who came to the rescue, focusing on Africa with massive infrastructure loans that allowed the continent’s governments to devote scarce resources to education, health and food security. When funds ran short, the same governments were encouraged to tap global financial markets to keep them solvent, adding to their already growing debt piles. Now the reductions in poverty seen over the last 15 years are about to be lost,  says the World Bank’s boss, David Malpass , as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the public finances of poorer countries. Figures due out next month are expected to show an extra 100 million people have been  pushed into poverty  by the crisis. Malpass praised some richer governments for extending debt repayment deadlines, but said he was dismayed at the attitude of private lenders and the Chinese, whom he accused of “free riding” on this taxpayer-funded debt forgiveness. “That’s not fair to the taxpayers of the countries providing development assistance and means poor countries don’t have the resources to deal with the humanitarian crisis,” he said. The World Bank warned last year that many governments, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, had borrowed too much and that their finances were dangerously unstable as a result. Now it says that central American and south American countries have also suffered so badly during the pandemic that their poverty levels are increasing. Malpass is right to criticise the private-sector and Chinese banks that hold so much of that debt. But he needs his friend Donald Trump to be more constructive in talks with Beijing and take a harder line on private lenders. Only then will we see meaningful action to cut debt levels.

15|Balfour Beatty to pay £49m fine for fraud against US military|2021-12-23|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military|British construction company  Balfour Beatty  will pay $65m (£49m) in fines after pleading guilty to fraud committed against the US military. The company’s US arm was one of the biggest providers of privatised military housing to the US army, navy and air forces at 55 bases across the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas, but it lied about repairs in order to increase bonus payments, the US Department of Justice said on Thursday. The company, a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, had to meet various maintenance and resident satisfaction targets to qualify for the bonuses. But employees deliberately altered data in its property management software and falsified resident comment cards to reach the required levels. The payout includes a $34m penalty plus nearly $32m in restitution, and the company will also be supervised for three years by an independent compliance monitor. It is not the first time that Balfour Beatty has been censured for defence-related work. In the UK in 2019 MI6 sacked the company as a contractor during refurbishment work after it  lost sensitive plans of the layout of its headquarters  in London’s Vauxhall, which are famously featured in several James Bond spy films. The deputy head of the FBI, which was also involved in the recent fraud inquiry, said it was a “disgraceful” crime. Two former Balfour Beatty managers, Stacy Cabrera and Rick Cunefare, have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the case this year. The fines are more than Balfour Beatty’s entire  profit before tax for 2020  of £48m, although they are only a small proportion of revenues of £8.6bn during that year. The company, valued at £1.6bn, is struggling with other problems in its main UK building business, which counts Hinkley Point nuclear power station and the  HS2 and Crossrail rail developments among its major projects . The chief executive, Leo Quinn, who was paid £2.1m in salary and bonuses in 2020, warned in August that the company would not take on any new property construction projects in central London after it was forced to prop up failing subcontractors. The US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said: “Instead of promptly repairing housing for US service members as required, Balfour Beatty lied about the repairs to pocket millions of dollars in performance bonuses. “This pervasive fraud was a consequence of Balfour Beatty’s broken corporate culture, which valued profit over the welfare of service members.” The fraud meant that crucial maintenance was delayed, harming military personnel and their families, the Department of Justice said. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Balfour Beatty said it had appointed a chief compliance officer for the US after carrying out a review when the fraud was first discovered, as well as adding further ethics and compliance training for all employees. “The wrongdoing that took place is completely contrary to the way the company expects its people to behave,” Balfour Beatty said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. “The company apologises for the actions of communities to all its stakeholders. It has been made clear to all employees that breaches of policies, procedures, or law will not be tolerated.” Topics Construction industry US military Balfour Beatty news Reuse this content|1
16|When the gig’s up, should we mourn our lost music venues?|2022-04-17|https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/17/when-the-gigs-up-should-we-mourn-our-lost-music-venues|O n Thursday night last week, Sea Power played a headline gig at the Roundhouse in London, a Grade II-listed former engine shed. A beautiful space and an important centre for youth arts education, it’s one of live music’s success stories. A week later, the band will play at Sheffield’s Leadmill, the centre of a  bitter row  after the venue’s landlords issued a notice of eviction. Arctic Monkeys, Pulp and the Kaiser Chiefs have all joined a campaign to save the Leadmill, in the vein of dozens of similar efforts over the years to save famous venues, from Manchester’s Haçienda to London’s Fabric nightclub and CBGBs in New York. Many smaller venues have shut after these battles failed. The Bull & Gate, where I first saw Sea Power play 20 years ago, was a pub just up the road from the Roundhouse, and is now closed, a fate shared by many rooms they’ve haunted during their long career. After a  battering from coronavirus , live music in the UK continues to struggle, with audiences wary of returning to crowded gigs, and grassroots venues taking on £90m of debt just to survive. A crowdfunding campaign by the Music Venue Trust has raised nearly £4.5m for 270 projects across the country. It can often feel that the picture for live music in Britain is beyond bleak, but it’s more complex than it can at first appear: it’s not just the fault of the usual culprits such as greedy landlords, property developers and moaning neighbours. The decline of regional touring reflects how, in an age of Netflix and gaming, live music now has to compete with far more demands on our cultural time and interest, not to mention wallets, in the middle of a  cost-of-living crisis . Old tour adverts show that bands would play numerous dates in one city, and visit places that no longer have live venues. The Wake Arms, in the middle of Epping Forest, once hosted gigs by Hawkwind and Genesis, while the now demolished West Runton Pavilion, out on the north Norfolk coast, welcomed the Sex Pistols, Chuck Berry and Black Sabbath. Saint Etienne on stage at the Leadmill in 2012.  Photograph: Gary Wolstenholme/Redferns/Getty Images A friend’s uncle who works in one of the shipyards in Plymouth told me the city’s problems went hand in hand with the decline of its music venues. He used to be able to watch bands such as the Fall every week – now most acts tend to travel only as far as Exeter. Without a musical culture, any region suffers. It’s easy to get misty-eyed about buildings, and some, such as the Haçienda, get elevated along with the nostalgia and myth-making for the scene they hosted. Friends who went to the club say that when it opened in 1982 it was often depressingly empty, and before closing in 1997 it had a nasty, heavy vibe, far from the euphoria of its acid house peak. There was widespread anger when London’s Astoria was  demolished to make way for Crossrail , yet it was a dilapidated box I remember only for bad sound, overcrowding and overpriced warm lager in cans. Venues come and go, and have their good and terrible phases. The churn of cities is part of what makes them exciting places to live, and that process is often more tricky than we might assume. In 2019, there was a campaign to save the Macbeth on London’s Hoxton Street after noise complaints from neighbours. However, when I lived around the corner in the early 2000s, the Macbeth was a genuine community boozer with an amazing karaoke night, and one year everyone sang me Happy Birthday. It was a blow when it became a music venue, and the formerly mixed crowd was dispersed. When venues serving marginalised people are closed, there tends to be less press outrage or campaigning to save them – the excellent if depressing Instagram account London Dead Pubs, full of before-and-after photographs of old Victorian drinking establishments replaced by anonymous flats, gives the histories of countless venues that served the black community with reggae and dub nights but were shut down with little in the way of mainstream protest. Whether they served a particular group of people, nurtured a musical movement, or (let’s not be snooty) a room where a covers band could get out of themselves for an hour of musical fantasy, the crime is that venues are rarely replaced, leaving many towns and cities without large and grassroots spaces alike. The Leadmill in Sheffield, which faces an uncertain future.  Photograph: Martyn Williams Photography/Alamy Look beyond the doom and gloom, and the picture is more mixed. In  Sheffield , new venues are being created in the redevelopment of the city centre, while Sidney & Matilda, Delicious Clam and Bal Fashions opened fairly recently and are all thriving. Cafe Oto, the London home of experimental music, has just celebrated its 14th birthday. In Yorkshire and Lancashire, the Transpennine underground is sustained by Hebden Bridge’s The Trades Club, Todmorden’s Golden Lion and Manchester’s notoriously feral White Hotel. Like Camden’s Roundhouse, Newcastle’s Boiler Shop saved an important part of our industrial heritage (the first steam locomotives were built there) and puts on industrial music from the likes of Einstürzende Neubauten alongside the wildly popular Bongo’s Bingo. These venues, providing services and entertainment beyond just music, show how it’s possible to adapt to survive. When I look back at the life-changing musical moments in my life (the uncanny murmur of Throbbing Gristle at Heaven, still dancing four hours before I had to get up for work every Monday at Trash at long-closed nightclub The End), it’s not the physical space I remember but the vibrating molecules, the feeling of collective joy within them. The same thing happened at the Roundhouse when, during their pro-immigration anthem Waving Flags, Sea Power lifted the roof off. Music venues are the incubators of connections and memories. As fans of music of all stripes, we need not just to lament the past but support those trying to do something new.

That was just over two years ago, in front of the evocative backdrop of Stephenson’s Rocket, and it came just days after he had entered Downing Street. To be honest, I could have written much of it myself. In the context of today’s confusion over what “levelling up” means, his words are well worth revisiting. Back then, the prime minister was possessed of that clarity and urgency that sometimes comes over politicians when they are new in office. He seemed to speak more as the former mayor of London than the country’s new leader. His vision for “levelling up” felt clear – now it is as clear as mud. London had been transformed over the past two decades, he told assembled political and business leaders from across the north of England, and he would now do exactly the same for us. “I want to be the prime minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London”, he said, making a specific pledge to get cracking immediately on the Leeds to  Manchester  section of the new line. That hasn’t happened and I have to say I would be surprised if the chancellor would give clearance to the prime minister to repeat the same pledge today. The storm clouds are gathering over Manchester Piccadilly when it comes to rail investment. All the rumours are that Northern Powerhouse Rail won’t be a new line like Crossrail, but instead is being downgraded to an enhancement of existing lines. We read that the eastern leg of HS2 into Yorkshire is  about to be chopped  altogether. I hope I am wrong, but I fear I am not. Perhaps there will be better news on intra-city public transport? The 2019 speech was crystal clear on this. “I will begin, as a matter of urgency, the transformation of local bus services – starting here today in Manchester,” he said. “I will work with the mayor on his plans to deliver a London-style bus system. I think we can see the first results, here in  Greater Manchester , within a few months.” We haven’t seen those results yet. But, to be fair, the government has made more progress on buses. Alongside other local areas, we have been invited to bid for capital and revenue funding. But will they provide enough to give us London-level frequency of services and London-level fares? In the capital, a single bus journey costs £1.55 and people can spend no more than £4.65 no matter how many bus journeys they take in a given day. Here in Greater Manchester, a single bus journey can cost as much as the London cap. I have already taken the decision to bring our buses back under public control and to integrate them with our trams to create the Bee Network. On our own it will take longer to increase the routes and cut the fares, but in partnership with central government we can go further and faster and deliver by May 2024 the levelled-up public transport system that Greater Manchester needs. If the prime minister were to commit today to London-level bus fares for Greater Manchester and elsewhere in England, it would certainly be noticed by voters. Finally, “levelling up” would mean something. That’s the prime minister’s task today – to take a phrase that is at risk of signifying everything and nothing and bring clarity back to the core mission of his government. The big question is whether he can square that with his chancellor. This is now the faultline at the heart of this government – between a prime minister who has raised expectations of major spending in neglected places up and down the country, and a chancellor who in his own conference speech was hinting at a new era of austerity. How this tension is resolved will determine the fate of the Conservatives at the next election in the “red wall” seats. If spending is so tight, the only answer is for it to be refocused on the areas of real need. The pandemic has shone a brutal spotlight on where those places are – and they are largely in the north. This is why George Osborne was right seven years ago when he promised that, at long last, the north of England would move from the back to the front of the queue for public investment. That is where this debate about regional inequality began. But, in the intervening years, other areas have challenged this prioritisation. We have moved from the specific promise of a “northern powerhouse” to the altogether more ambiguous language of “levelling up”. And now, if the post-pandemic pot of money is to be reduced, as the chancellor is suggesting, then the levelling-up largesse will be spread so thin that no one will notice it. We will find out what levelling up actually means when the government delivers its spending review later this month. But today we should get a sense of where the prime minister’s thinking is going. Greater Manchester has tried to provide him with a solution. We have put a big positive offer to the government in the form of a  Levelling Up Deal for our city-region , linking zero-carbon public transport to new and retrofitted zero-carbon housing and creating thousands of good jobs in the process. We would get the funding and powers to deliver those things and, in return, the government would be able to hold us to account. If Johnson were to stand up in Manchester today and say that he will be striking that deal, it would move us all beyond the debates of the recent past and help the country come back together after the pandemic. How about it, prime minister?

18|Tories’ rail spin won’t wash in the north, as plug is pulled on the powerhouse|2021-11-18|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/18/tory-spin-on-hs2-derailment-wont-wash-in-underinvested-north|For many people in the north of England, the integrated rail review heralds less of a rail revolution than a rail betrayal. There will be relief among those whose houses were  due to be bulldozed  to make way for HS2’s eastern spur, as well as those who always viewed that project as an unforgivable waste of money  that would primarily benefit London . But good luck finding many people who welcome the government’s downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), which should have been a new east-west line connecting the north’s key cities. Perhaps it is due to the planners never getting as far as sending compulsory purchase letters to properties obstructing the route or disturbing Peak District bats. But everyone who has had the misfortune of relying on the northern railways will agree that massive investment is needed to improve reliability and journey times. And, crucially, there is a need to increase capacity. Even the petrolheads who would happily tarmac the Pennine Way would probably vote for NPR because it would stop the M62 becoming more of a car park than a motorway during the rush hour. Train lines are already full, with demand projected to increase by between 78% and 200% by 2050. Vehicles queue on the M62 motorway between junctions 21 and 22.  Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA Slow-moving freight trains often hold up passenger services and small local services are severely constrained by sharing track with faster mainline services, which take priority three times an hour. The government is trying to spin the idea that its latest plans are better than the ones it promised years ago, because they will allow passengers to see quicker improvements. But much of the “new” rail review simply exhumes old schemes from the graveyard of broken pledges. Given that it was the Conservative government that  cancelled plans  to electrify the Midlands mainline and TransPennine route in 2017, breaking 2015 manifesto commitments, it is difficult to see why the north should be grateful to see both projects back on the table. 00:56 Boris Johnson denies 'betrayal' of northern England as HS2 plan scaled back – video The  2019 manifesto  said: “We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.” Some may question if ministers can claim to be “building” a new line if all they are doing is constructing a little bit of new track and then carrying out an upgrade that was promised six years ago. And what about poor old  Bradford , a city of missed opportunity? The fifth largest metropolitan authority in England, it has a growing population of 542,100. A total of 26.3% of the population are aged under 18, compared with 21.4% nationally, making it the youngest city in the UK. Yet no trains run through Bradford. They all stop and turn around again, at one of the two tiny stations. Boris Johnson’s rail plan: what’s in it and what was promised Read more It is a cul-de-sac of more than half a million people. Currently, the 10-mile journey from Bradford to  Leeds  takes 20 minutes on the fastest service. But you can travel 38 miles to London from Reading (population: 220,000) in 24 minutes. In fairness, the government never promised Bradford an NPR stop, despite it being a key demand from  Transport  for the North (TfN), the strategic body set up by the Conservatives to advise the government on the region’s transport needs – and then consistently ignored. It now says simply electrifying the line to Leeds will cut the journey time to a more sensible 12 minutes. It is possible party politics could have come into play. Bradford’s three inner-city MPs are Labour, with two Tories in the outer seats of Shipley and Keighley, represented by the backbenchers Philip Davies and the newcomer Robbie Moore. It is worth bearing in mind  an article  written by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the Yorkshire Post in 2017, when he was still a backbencher, which said: “London has Crossrail, the Midlands is getting HS2, and now we in the north need the government to back Northern Powerhouse Rail.” Voters should probably know that when the government boasts  of investing £360m  in smart ticketing, it  cancelled Transport for the North’s project  to do just that in the north (but for less than half the price) earlier this year. And while it can find no money to fund a modern station in Bradford, it is willing to pay to  explore restoring a passenger service to Stocksbridge , a former steel town near Sheffield, which is home to fewer than 10,000 people. It just so happens Stocksbridge returned its first Tory MP since 1935 in the last general election.

19|Crossrail opening date likely to be summer 2021|2020-01-10|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/crossrail-delays-opening-date-summer-2021-elizabeth-line|The opening of the Elizabeth line in central London will be  further delayed  to summer 2021, according to Crossrail’s latest official assessment, with full services across the route coming in mid-2022. The forecast opening would be two and a half years beyond the original deadline, and another three to six months past the revised window set last year by the chief executive, Mark Wild. However, they are more optimistic than  the “planning assumptions”  divulged by London’s transport commissioner, Mike Brown, this week, of an autumn 2021 opening. Wild said Bond Street station, whose construction was lagging behind, could be operational when the Elizabeth line opens after all. Crossrail said the forecast was based on progress with the software for its signalling and train systems. Intensive test-running of train services along the route will begin later this year. Transport for London (TfL) operates services on existing railways in west London from Paddington and east from Liverpool Street, which will eventually join up as the full Elizabeth line. Should the central section, tunnelled between Paddington and Abbey Wood, open in summer 2021, Crossrail anticipates full opening a year later. Direct services from Heathrow and Reading in the west to Shenfield in the east will follow in mid-2022. Wild said there were “no shortcuts” to building the railway. He said: “We continue to make  good progress with the central section  now reaching substantial completion and we are increasingly confident that Bond Street station will be ready to open with the rest of the railway. “Our latest assessment is that Elizabeth line services through central  London  will commence in summer 2021 – but we are aiming to open the railway as soon as we can. “The key focus for everyone on the Crossrail project is commencing intensive testing of the Elizabeth line as soon as we can in 2020, to enable passenger service as early as possible in 2021.” All stations, bar Bond Street and Whitechapel, would be substantially complete by the end of March, Crossrail said, with the final two ready by the end of 2020. Intensive trials, with multiple trains simulating the actual planned service, should start this autumn. Crossrail said the new timescale would not cause it to break the  revised budget announced in November 2019 , of just over £18bn. Construction delays, design changes and problems with signalling systems and software have heaped costs on Europe’s largest infrastructure project, whose former bosses had repeatedly claimed it was meeting its £14.8bn budget and timetable  until just months before its 2018 due date . The problems have also been hugely costly to TfL in lost fare revenue. Its business plan, published last month, shows it expects income from passengers to be  reduced by £1.3bn  as a result of Crossrail’s delayed opening. A spokesman for the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “As the mayor has made clear, it is vital that Crossrail’s new leadership team continues to be open and transparent with Londoners about the complex challenges that need to be addressed to enable the line to open. “TfL and the Department for Transport, as joint sponsors, will continue to hold the Crossrail leadership to account to ensure it is doing everything it can to open Crossrail safely and as soon as possible, and to mitigate further cost pressures.” Topics Crossrail Transport Rail transport London TfL Rail industry City transport news Reuse this content|1
20|£18bn Crossrail line delayed again to autumn 2021|2020-01-06|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/crossrail-line-delayed-autumn-2021|London transport authorities do not expect the £18bn  Crossrail  line to open before autumn 2021, in the latest delay to Europe’s largest infrastructure project. The capital’s transport commissioner said the latest working assumption was that the central section of the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, will start operating between September and December next year. “We’ve looked at a delay until the later stages of 2021, in terms of our business planning assumption,” Mike Brown said. “The assumption we’ve made is, I suppose, at the pessimistic end. But it’s the pragmatic end.” Before Brown’s announcement, Transport for London had said the line would open between 2020 and March 2021. Brown told London assembly members on Monday that Crossrail had underestimated the scale of the task remaining, with some  stations apparently near completion  but then requiring more work to replace systems and wiring. TfL’s business plan, published last month, has admitted the  delays would cost the organisation more than £1.3bn in lost revenue .  A further delay will be embarrassing and costly for TfL, after the  London  Underground boss, Mark Wild, was brought in as chief executive to improve management of the project. The Elizabeth line was set to be opened by the Queen on 9 December 2018, a date that was postponed only three months before the official ceremony. Brown’s guidance to the London assembly’s budget committee on Monday comes less than three weeks after Wild said he still  believed spring 2021 was feasible . Wild had initially set out the range of 2020 to March 2021 as a realistic timeframe to complete the troubled project. Challenges including rewriting signalling software would dictate when the line could open, Wild said late last year, with about nine months required for running test trains. The target opening date is expected to be officially revised this month, after a Crossrail board meeting on Thursday. The overall budget for the line has escalated to £18.25bn, from £14.8bn. The Elizabeth line is expected to carry more than 200 million passengers a year across London, linking Heathrow and Reading in the west and Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east, via the West End and Canary Wharf. A TfL spokesperson said: “The Crossrail team continues to make progress completing the railway and is moving forward with the complex testing of the signalling and train systems so that the railway can be handed over safely and reliably for passenger service. As Crossrail Ltd previously announced, the Elizabeth line will open as soon as practically possible in 2021. “As part of our annual business planning process, we have made some prudent assumptions including that the central section of the railway could open in autumn 2021, but continue to support Crossrail Ltd in delivering the railway as soon as possible.” Topics Crossrail Rail industry Transport policy Transport Rail transport London news Reuse this content|1
21|On the rocks: gin club derailed by Crossrail|2019-12-14|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/14/soho-gin-club-derailed-crossrail|One of Soho’s most treasured institutions has become the latest London business to castigate Crossrail for threatening its future. The  London Gin Club , formerly the Star Cafe, is facing a year’s closure because of flooding triggered by Europe’s  largest and much delayed  £18bn infrastructure project. The club, one of the oldest family-run establishments in Soho, has been closed since April after damage to its Georgian vault was caused by drilling at the nearby Tottenham Court Road station. The club’s repair bill is expected to top £600,000 although  Crossrail  has so far refused to pay compensation. “It is utterly, unspeakably preposterous,” said the club’s owner, Julia Forte. “We simply cannot get our heads around the fact that they caused the damage, which was foreseeable and avoidable and will not accept liability.” The London Gin Club poster issued to Crossrail Last month it was revealed that Crossrail will not open until at least 2021, a delay of three years – prompting fresh dismay from small businesses affected by the disruption caused by the postponement. In the case of the  London  Gin Club, its woes started in January when Crossrail workers began digging above the Georgian building’s basement. Now, every time it rains, up to 70 litres of water pours into the basement. Forte said Crossrail’s loss adjuster had told the club to “fill the vault with cement and put a door on it”.  However, Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild has since visited the business.  “He was horrified at the state of the place which by then had serious penetrating damp,” said Forte. “Our business is in ruins, our building is still trashed and Crossrail have not showed any consideration for our situation,” she added. Wild said: “I am very sorry for the disruption the London Gin Club has suffered and we are doing everything possible to expedite the insurance process as quickly as possible so the business can re-open. I have been in regular contact with the Gin Club to keep them updated and we are making good progress.” Topics London The Observer Crossrail news Reuse this content|1
22|"The Tories won’t ‘level up’ the north while they’re in thrall to London | Simon Jenkins"|2022-02-04|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/tories-level-up-north-london-michael-gove|"M ichael Gove should be a bishop, not a politician. He smiles. He nods. He declares “missions” and blesses all and sundry. His current diocese is Britain’s northern cities, which are suffering the worst regional disparity of any OECD country and said to be crippling the British economy. Boris Johnson has acknowledged this in his “levelling up” agenda. But to govern is to govern, not just to mean well. Gove’s Wednesday sermon on levelling up  meant well , but he might have been speaking of a distant province of a forgotten empire. The people of the north, he said, deserved better transport, better education, better housing, training, health, science, anything you cared to mention. They should have it, God willing. He promised that mayors would be appointed, plans formulated and 22,000 civil servants sent out from London, like missionaries to the unwashed. But please don’t mention money. It is so vulgar. Levelling-up: some wealthy areas of England to see 10 times more funding than poorest Read more The clear reality is that British regional policy has barely moved on since the days of Clement Attlee. Gove’s speech could have been delivered in 1947. To him, the cities of the north need big government and central spending. Making them level with the south is about more infrastructure and more welfare. That is what macho British ministers always say: theirs is a job for spades, diggers and hi-vis jackets. If this was the end of the matter, the outlook for levelling up would be bleak, as it would seem there is no money to spare. Yet I tried to imagine the citizens of Frankfurt, Toulouse or Milan, let alone New York or Los Angeles, hanging on the goodwill of distant politicians for their future. I tried to imagine them being patted on the head by Gove and told to be patient. The whole Gove project is unreal. The only region Whitehall recognises is London. Reality is the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s infrastructure mega-projects: Crossrail in central London and a high-speed commuter line into London from Birmingham. Sunak embodies the so-called Matthew effect: “To them that hath shall it be given.” The great unmentioned truth in any debate on the north-south divide is not the deprivation of the north, serious though it may be. It is the magnetism of London. It is summed up in a meeting of Manchester businessmen I once attended. They never mentioned infrastructure. They cried with one voice, “Why does London steal our young people?” I likewise recall a northern woman telling me that all her children and grandchildren had gone south, and never would return. When I commiserated, she beamed and said, “Oh no. They’ve all done very well.” Gove did hint at this in his mission to improve something called “pride of place”. The dominance of London over all other English cities is unlike that of the capital of any other developed country. At its root is the steady disempowerment of these cities, stripped of their self-government until they are mere agencies of Whitehall. Northern cities cannot now await London cash, least of all those not among Gove’s bizarre “top 20”, chosen for his special favour. Their revival will only start with a newly confident local leadership. Gove hints at more devolution and localism – a political promise so often made but never fulfilled. England’s current elected mayors are a powerless shambles that confuse cities and regions. Liverpool and Bristol both have two overlapping ones. Every city and town should clearly have one mayor, executive and plenipotentiary. This is extremely common in Europe. The additional devolution of wider local control has had mixed results in Wales and Scotland, but it unquestionably boosts local pride and morale. Gove should give cities and counties tax-raising powers and far more fiscal discretion. With local taxes accounting for such a tiny percentage of public sector revenue, this is a recipe for Whitehall deciding everything. Virtually the only real discretion British provincial cities have is over property development. This is why the leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol can think of no way of competing with London other than by erecting garish towers of luxury flats in their central areas. They ignore the evidence that modern “creative clusters” – in design, marketing, the arts and entertainment – are drawn to historic neighbourhoods and old converted buildings. Manchester’s Northern Quarter and Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter are the Sohos and Shoreditches of the future, yet they are desperately under-protected. Gove’s levelling up targets ‘highly unlikely to be met’, experts say Read more Northern cities regard their Victorian heritage as a liability not an asset. They should ponder last week’s lavish London edition of Country Life. Significantly not a single modern development was pictured. Every up-and-coming neighbourhood, street or house in the magazine was built in the 19th century or before. That is true magnetism. The idea that government bulldozers and concrete mixers will reignite the vitality of these places is absurd. They need saving, not digging. If conservation is one spur to civic renewal, the other is culture. Britain’s artistic and creative life is dominated by London. To see Hull and now  Coventry  declared “UK city of culture” is heartwarming – for Hull in 2017 it was  worth a reported £220m  in investment. But it demonstrates the yawning gulf with the capital. Every modern city should be a city of culture, all the time, and not have to be declared it (by London). The report last week that the V&A and the British Museum had brushed aside Gove’s request to establish northern branches spoke volumes about modern Britain. He is the boss. He should emphatically redirect cultural spending away from London, and compel its museums to disgorge from their basements hidden treasures that belong not to them but to the nation. Last week the streets of London’s West End were heaving as the capital roared back to pre-Covid prosperity. You could feel the excitement. But the metropolis is truly blessed. Its galleries and museums, its music and opera are heavily subsidised, as is its transportation. We all know that London’s taxes support the north, but as my Manchester businessmen complained, it “taxes” the rest of Britain of its youthful talent in return. If Johnson is to deny the north large sums of public spending, he can at least demand that London offers instead some of its magnetism. For it is that magnetism that will help the north back to prosperity. England’s great cities should be liberated to recover the civic pride they once enjoyed. That is their one secure renaissance.

23|"UK railways are heading into a perfect storm. Now is the time to nationalise them | Christian Wolmar"|2022-01-10|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/10/uk-railways-nationalise|"“So, Mum/Dad, what are the railways for?” That is the question the UK rail industry will be dreading hearing in a post-pandemic world.  This is not quite the existential crisis rail faced in the aftermath of the extensive   Beeching cuts  to the network in the mid-1960s, but that’s cold comfort. There is a considerable risk that services are going to deteriorate massively in 2022, sending the sector into the kind of downward spiral that was last experienced in the 1970s and 1980s. By the financial year’s end, passengers may well be paying higher fares for a service of fewer and more crowded trains, departing from stations stripped of staff. And the result of that will be to push more people into using cars, but also to critically undermine the government’s “levelling up” promise, since poorer people are far more dependent on public transport. It’s a perfect storm. Unsurprisingly given the restrictions on travel and the instruction to work from home, revenue from rail fares  dropped to a fifth  of pre-pandemic levels during the 2020-21 financial year. The need to keep services running for key workers throughout lockdowns meant government subsidy rose from  about £5bn to a very generous £17bn  to prevent the network from collapsing. While this figure does include some modest investment to improve the network, that level of support will not be sustainable for long. The pandemic already led to significant change in the funding of the railways, when in September 2020, the franchise system created during privatisation in the mid-1990s was scrapped. Under franchises, private operators kept the fares, giving them an incentive to generate income through price increases and extra passenger numbers. Now the industry is being run through management contracts, which means the government effectively keeps all the fares but bears the risk if fewer people use the railways. The end of franchising was initially a temporary fix but has now become a permanent change as recommended by last year’s  Williams-Shapps review  of the industry. That review was already under way at the start of the pandemic – triggered by the chaotic  May 2018 timetable change  which resulted in widespread disruption because of the lack of coordination between operators and Network Rail. In light of the pandemic, its recommendations have led to the Treasury now demanding operators cut costs by 10% over the next year and a 3.8% fare rise in March, while the Department for Transport is looking at reductions to the timetable.     Reduced timetables to come in on all of Great Britain’s rail network Read more But these cuts will have a severe impact on the level of service because the biggest spending areas for rail operators are on fixed costs such as station buildings, rolling stock and track maintenance, which are the same regardless of how many people use services. Other costs, such as fuel, electricity, platform staff and drivers are relatively low. The only way to save money is to dramatically reduce staff or to make severe inroads into the timetable, which will in turn impact revenue, creating a vicious circle. The unions are already preparing industrial action to combat these cuts, which will further disrupt services. At the same time, £500m is being spent on schemes to reverse some of the Beeching cuts. While that is welcome, reopening lightly used lines with an infrequent service seems an odd priority. Meanwhile, about  £98bn may be spent  over the next few years on HS2. This apparently contradictory position of building new services while existing ones are being cut   reflects the Treasury’s view that capital expenditure is a “good thing” while operating expenditure, which by its nature recurs every year, is inherently “bad”. But this largesse in favour of HS2 is also putting the squeeze on other more modest enhancements and will result in a poorer service as temporary speed restrictions are imposed on dodgy sections of track. Escape from this perfect storm is possible. The Williams-Shapps report recommended the creation of a strategic body to oversee the railways, to be called, in a flourish of boosterism, “Great British Railways”. It will take over Network Rail, which is already state-owned, and provide a long-term plan for the railways. But as ever, the devil is in the detail.  A government with a sense of history and an open mind would look to the British Rail of the past for a blueprint of how to run a successful railway. In its final decade before privatisation, it created three sectors – InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways – that had considerable independence in the areas of investment and timetabling. Allowing British Rail this freedom resulted in a blend of business imperatives backed by a strong public sector ethos that was successful. It became Europe’s most efficient railway. Sadly, all that was lost to privatisation, and while the collapse of the franchising system could provide an opportunity to recreate it, a continuing ideological obsession with private-sector involvement means that the increased costs and complexity that have characterised the railways in the past quarter of a century will remain. This matters for our transport system, but it matters more than that – because a good rail connection is a passport to prosperity. Look, for example, at how Margate has been transformed thanks to the  half-hour reduction  in journey time to London. As a corollary, look at how decline has been hastened in towns cut off from the rail network by Beeching. Railways have always been a catalyst of economic growth and prosperity, but politicians throughout history have often failed to recognise this. Some are commercially successful, some aren’t. So what? No one ever asks why the B-road to Nether Hopping should be kept open even though few cars use it on a daily basis. A properly funded, properly configured railway would cost a lot of money over the next few years until passenger numbers recovered, but railways are more than trains and tracks: they are an essential part of the fabric of the country. There is a moral case here, and politically there is the opportunity to make a popular case for a publicly owned, integrated railway – run independently of state interference. Labour should take it.

24|Why are Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak at odds over net zero plans?|2021-10-20|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/20/why-are-boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-at-odds-over-net-zero-plans|Publication of the government’s blueprint to hit net zero by 2050 has opened up a  rift between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak  over spending. The chancellor is concerned on many levels about the prime minister’s tendency to believe that “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds”, a phrase Voltaire used in his novel Candide to lampoon the optimists of mid-18th-century France. According to Treasury insiders, Johnson is far too sanguine about Britain’s ability to emerge from the pandemic and tackle the climate emergency without meticulous planning and careful management of the public finances. Sunak used his  Conservative party conference speech  – which made no mention of the environment or net zero – to warn that excessive government borrowing and “stacking up bills for future generations to pay” was immoral. What is Johnson asking for? There is a  long list of spending  on transition arrangements to reach net zero that Johnson wants to push ahead with and is willing to put on the UK’s credit card if necessary. They range from grants to install  low-carbon heat pumps  to new nuclear power stations. This is not as reckless as it sounds when interest rates are at rock bottom, and economic theory says there is a huge potential return on investments in a modern infrastructure, especially when they also happen to be green. What are those investment benefits? It varies from one industry to the next, but commonly government can expect to get back £1.20 to £1.80 for every £1 spent when it invests in infrastructure. Of course, this multiplier effect only works if the money is invested wisely. The aim is not just to replace out-of-date equipment, buildings and technology, but do it in such a way that the people who use it are more productive without warming the planet. How does Johnson want to  invest in net zero ? Subsidies can create a market for green projects where none existed before, mainly because the upfront costs deter private companies in search of a profit. Once the market is thriving, prices tend to come down and the subsidies can be withdrawn. Later the funds can be deployed elsewhere. Sunak and Johnson agree on the need to provide subsidies and attract private investment but  disagree on the amount of government cash  that should be on offer and for how long. Why is Sunak so reticent? The Treasury is an anxious beast. It may appear arrogant, especially when resisting attempts to devolve financial decision-making away from Westminster. But it is distrustful of other Whitehall departments, which are viewed as spendthrifts lacking the financial discipline to manage complex projects. Green public transport should be the goal of any net zero strategy, but Treasury officials are known to despair of their counterparts in the transport ministry after significant cost overruns on London’s Elizabeth line, also known as Crossrail, and HS2. Has the Treasury’s culture proved a barrier? Treasury officials also like to avoid taking risks. Investing in the north of England, the Midlands and the south-west as part of Johnson’s levelling up plans are deemed perilously uncertain when compared with the guaranteed returns to be made in London and the south-east. The same thinking is prevalent when net zero initiatives are considered. Johnson’s record of splashing cash on friends and Conservative business contacts when the pandemic hit, much of which was wasted, has only underscored concerns about the prospect of wasteful spending if No 10 moves too quickly. Why does Sunak say borrowing is a tax on young people? Sunak objects to further increases in borrowing, arguing that the extra debt will need to be paid by future generations. It is a common thread running through the speeches of most free-market Conservative MPs and ignores the benefits for future generations of a less polluted, more biodiverse environment supported by green jobs. Young people will not thank today’s policymakers if a refusal to borrow limits the speed of transition. Does that mean tax rises to fund the transition to net zero? In a paper on Tuesday to accompany Johnson’s spending plans, Sunak said a rebalancing of the tax system would be necessary once fossil fuels begin to be phased out. Just as it would dent the exchequer if people stopped smoking or drinking alcohol, a reduction in petrol and diesel use will hit fuel duty receipts, currently worth £37bn to the Treasury. Sunak did not say where he was looking to get an alternative source of revenue, but there is no sign he will increase income tax. The road user lobby expect the chancellor to back pay-as-you-drive charges once electric cars dominate the roads.

25|Khan and Shapps try to put differences aside as Northern line extension opens |2021-09-20|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/20/khan-and-shapps-try-to-put-differences-aside-as-northern-line-extension-opens|Rarely can so much bonhomie have been generated by a Monday morning trip on the Northern line. As the  £1.1bn London Underground extension  opened for the first time, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and London mayor, Sadiq Khan, rode west together to Battersea Power Station – and talked up the teamwork for a project that has finally come in under budget and on time. Services started at 5.28am, with enthusiasts queueing outside the new Battersea Power Station tube station for a slice of underground history: the Battersea and Nine Elms stops are the first new stations in more than a decade. Some were racing from the other end: a man with a homemade “first passenger for Battersea from Mill Hill East” sign stapled to his T-shirt jostled for position in camera shot when the VIPs arrived. How many residents of the new Battersea Power Station will be catching a morning tube remains to be seen, with multimillion penthouses still on sale and the cheapest of the 254 flats costing north of £800,000. But the redevelopment, with its riverfront picnic tables, entertainment venues and swanky boutiques already in place, and Apple’s HQ and the main power station conversion to come next year, will surely soon be luring more passengers down. Penthouses and poor doors: how Europe's 'biggest regeneration project' fell flat Read more The thorny question remains of how London will fund its transport system, with only a fraction of the fare revenue coming in since the coronavirus outbreak. While train and bus operators outside London have had the loss of their spiralling fares underwritten by the Treasury, the government has been decidedly less forthcoming in helping a Labour mayor who kept fares down. The funding crisis has been exacerbated by delays to Crossrail, the new east-west line, which is due to eventually open next year  as the Elizabeth line . Khan, certainly, was hoping that some valuable lessons would be drummed into Shapps, with the current funding agreement for Transport for  London  set to expire in December, and talks ongoing on how to secure London’s financial base. “It’s got to be a long-term deal and we’ve got to change the funding model,” the mayor said. “On a formula where we have got to have 72% of our services paid for by fares coming in, it’s not sustainable. Before the pandemic we had 4m tube journeys a day – we’re nowhere near there.” He was keen, he said, to get Shapps to the opening of Northern line extension “to show the difference the government working with City Hall, public sector, private sector, can make. A London recovery benefits the national recovery. Every £1 you spend here, 55p is spent elsewhere in the country.” Shapps, though, was drawing other lessons, tweeting a photo of himself and Khan in full power pose under the “Power” on the station nameplate, announcing: “Thanks to government funding, two brand-new tube stations opened …” This may have been news to  TfL , and especially the Greater London Authority and developers, who picked up the other 90% of the tab with loans to be funded by future increased business levies. Having claimed the credit, Shapps was at pains to say that far more money was being spent “levelling up” the north: about £29bn on transport since 2010, he claimed. On a more conciliatory note, he added: “We have to look after the capital as well, we’re committed to doing that, and today’s a great example of different groups coming together in partnership and doing something really great.” Nonetheless, the transport secretary warned: “TfL will have to take, and has had to take, some very difficult decisions in order to make sure the finances stack up. The government’s put in, I think, £4.1bn so far and counting. We’re going to have further conversations with them …. We have to expect TfL to make adjustments.” But standing in front of the gleaming Battersea station, serenaded by a community choir, that unpleasantness could wait. “Look, today’s a day when we got together and built something worthwhile for Londoners,” Shapps said. “We should stick on that positive note for today.”  This article was amended on 21 September 2021. The two Northern Line stops are the first new stations on the underground system in more than a decade, rather than since the millennium.

26|Oxford Street: why London’s shopping mecca can’t trade on past glories|2021-12-26|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/oxford-street-why-londons-shopping-mecca-cant-trade-on-past-glories|The Christmas lights are on along the nation’s busiest high street, but beneath their festive glow about a quarter of the outlets are either empty, or housing temporary shops. Alongside the shuttered stores and building sites on London’s Oxford Street are now at least a dozen shops selling confectionery, cheap souvenirs or perfume, giving it the air of a rundown seaside resort rather than a global retail destination. Big names including Topshop, Debenhams, Gap, French Connection and Carphone Warehouse have disappeared, while others, such as Next and Monsoon have reduced their space. And little wonder: in the second year of the pandemic, sales in the Oxford Street area, including Regent Street and Bond Street, dropped by £8bn to £2bn last year and are expected to reach just £5bn this year, according to trade body the New West End Company (NWEC). The vast former House of Fraser department store will close next month before it is redeveloped into offices and a rooftop restaurant above a smaller shop and a basement gym with a pool. Both Marks & Spencer and  John Lewis  are considering converting some of their retail space into offices and leisure facilities. Drapers, bonnet makers and saddlers began to take over from pubs and theatres on Oxford Street at the end of the 18th century, and these changes mark a historic retreat from retail’s national stronghold. The Oxford Street House of Fraser will close for redevelopment next month.  Photograph: Matt Crossick/Alamy “I do think we have hit the bottom,” says Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of NWEC. The 1.2-mile long shopping street is in the throes of major change, with Covid accelerating the switch to buying online and in more local shops. This has driven away commuters, day trippers and international tourists. But Oxford Street is still devoted almost exclusively to retail. It has just one pub, and very few dining outlets facing the thoroughfare. (There are, however, restaurants and cafes in department stores such as Selfridges and John Lewis.) Redevelopments promise more entertainment and dining alongside office space and leisure facilities such as gyms and crazy golf. There may also be more flats, which is not new: in Victorian times it was common for shop staff to be housed above the store. Mark Robinson, chair of the government’s  High Streets Task Force , says Oxford Street’s future must be about reacting to consumer and stakeholder demands: “Its location and heritage give it an enormous start.” The street has reinvented itself before: in the early 18th century the Roman road out of London had become a muddy track by the time it reached the gallows at Tyburn, now known as Marble Arch. A building boom in the 1700s saw terraced houses replace the street’s animal pounds and seedy pubs. The houses were soon converted into retail spaces, with workrooms above, for drapers, bootmakers and milliners. In the early 1800s there was a trend for “bazaars” – indoor markets that often included entertainment as well as stalls. In the 1870s, as outlined in the  Survey of London , department stores emerged (Vol 53: Oxford Street,   edited by Andrew Saint and published for the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London). The risk of a new business in central London was too expensive, but lower rents open opportunities for experiment and innovation Paul Swinney, Centre for Cities Marshall & Snelgrove, on the site of the now-empty Debenhams, was among the first, but of the Victorian retail giants only John Lewis remains. Well-known names including Peter Robinson, Bourne & Hollingsworth and furniture maker Waring & Gillow are long gone.  Before retail took over, Oxford Street was an entertainment hotspot, home to several theatres, starting with the Pantheon in 1772. That gave its name and site to the Marks & Spencer store east of Oxford Circus. There have been churches on the street, as well as hospitals and several pubs – only one of which, the Flying Horse near Tottenham Court Road, survives. Lyons, the tearooms operator, once had three “corner houses” on Oxford Street, and training rooms in the building that is now Marks & Spencer Marble Arch. Tyrrell says Oxford Street must look to its history to build a more “European approach”, with food and drink services, entertainment, seating and greenery serving offices above. “We still think that by 2024 we will be back to £10bn of sales – even given what has happened in the world – but this will be from a very different mix and different customer. There will be more people working, a longer dwell time and more domestic shoppers coming to London.” Rents in the street have fallen by up to 50%, according to Tyrrell, and that could foster new ideas. Paul Swinney at the Centre for Cities thinktank agrees: “In the past the risk of trading [for a new business] in the centre of London was too expensive. If that comes down, it opens a new business opportunity for experiment and innovation.” For that to succeed, though, work must be done on making Oxford Street a more attractive place to dally. Westminster council has pledged to £150m of public realm improvements, including more greenery and seating, but it ditched plans for  temporary piazzas on either side of Oxford Circus this year  after an early attempt to lure back the crowds backfired. The Peter Robinson department store in Oxford Street, circa 1905.  Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy The  widely mocked £6m Marble Arch Mound , an artificial hill intended as an attraction linking Oxford Street to Hyde Park, had to switch to free entry after only two days, and is set to close next month. Westminster council now plans wide consultation before confirming its plans to improve the look and feel of the street. But finding a happy solution could be tough. Traffic has been reduced and the pavements widened in recent years, but it’s hard to engender a leisured atmosphere amid a constant stream of buses and taxis, with no space for slower transport such as bicycles. The traffic problems seem endemic: witnesses to a royal commission more than a century ago, in 1903, complained that there were too many buses on Oxford Street. Proposals for improvement have varied from a 1960s plan for a deck above the street to carry shoppers via a travelator and a 1970s scheme for a track carrying cars on air cushions, to numerous calls for full pedestrianisation. Today the street is banking on Crossrail, or the Elizabeth Line, which will ferry in shoppers from further afield if it  opens this spring,  at least four years later than once hoped. Plans for improvement have “got to get moving fast”, according to Tyrrell. “The next couple of years we have got a window,” he says. “Not just retail but all brands will be looking at the street. When we get into the spring and summer, and customers and office workers are back, that’s when trends and perceptions are going to be set. We have to make sure we are ready to take that opportunity.”  This article was amended on 11 January 2022 to give fuller details of and the correct link to the Survey of London relating to Oxford Street.

27|"Opportunity knocks for Michael Gove – but will he take it? | Simon Jenkins"|2021-11-26|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/26/opportunity-knocks-michael-gove-levelling-up|"T he whale is wounded. The sharks smell blood and start to circle. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is in the lead. The rest thrash about, still disoriented by Covid. That is, except for  Michael Gove . Last September, in an unguarded moment, Boris Johnson handed Gove the opportunity of a lifetime: to chart a path out of the ideological chaos of lockdown towards a 21st-century Tory dawn, and, with it, a claim to the succession. Gove has been asked in effect to recast non-metropolitan Britain. He must revive local democracy and reverse the centralist planning regime of his predecessor, Robert Jenrick – the regime that so  enraged Chesham’s Tories  in the June byelection. Gove must sort out the intellectual vacuum that is Conservative housing policy, with its casual pledge of 300,000 new homes. He must also reveal what Johnson really meant by  “levelling-up” the north . He has even been told to rescue the union with Scotland in his spare time. If he can pull all this off, Gove will be a hard man to beat. At the heart of Jenrick’s planning fiasco lay a confusion over housing. A true Tory would leave houses to the marketplace and concentrate on homelessness among poor people. The trouble began with Margaret Thatcher “weaponising” housing subsidy as a middle-class vote-winner, with property developers piling in as her party’s leading financial backers, pressing at every turn for planning decontrol. Jenrick was putty in their hands. This reached its nadir with this year’s algorithmic targets for new development. This defined housing “need” as demand represented by price. New estates were imposed on every town and village, wherever prices were rising fastest: a developer’s dream. First-time-buyer subsidies merely pushed up prices – overwhelmingly in London and the south-east. Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire began to go the way of Middlesex. Johnson even found himself protesting over new estates in his own constituency. As of today, about 400,000 houses granted permissions remain unbuilt, their builders fearing too many houses might damage profits. Appearing last month before a Commons committee, Gove signalled a radical change of gear. He ordered a “ complete rethink ” of Jenrick’s planning reforms. He promised that communities would be re-empowered to “take back control” of their future development. He wanted to see brownfield sites developed and opposed carbon-guzzling “concrete and steel” materials. He was also sceptical of housing policy as being only about new-build. The supply of properties to the market is overwhelming existing buildings. ‘This is not democracy’: Tories accused of selling out to developers Read more Britain has some of the most inefficient and underoccupied houses in Europe, largely through longstanding undertaxing of living space. A luxury London flat may pay barely a tenth of the tax on one in New York City. This combined with high stamp duty is a tax against downsizing, and has led the Resolution Foundation to argue that fiscal policy should hold the key to housing policy. Half a million homes lie empty as “savings”. About 600,000 houses could be nudged back on to the market “without the need to lift a single brick”. London’s half-vacant luxury towers and Georgian terraces make a  mockery  of housing targets. Whether Gove has the clout to take on the Treasury’s aversion to fiscal reform remains to be seen but is a real test of his seriousness. Gove seems determined to reset the balance between Whitehall and local communities on the future of land use. His advisers are tending towards urban densification and renewal rather than clear-and-build. The champion of more traditionally planned towns, Nicholas Boys Smith of the thinktank Create Streets, has been appointed head of Gove’s new Office for Place. This is intended to promote a popular, perhaps more aesthetic, kind of planning, in contrast with Whitehall’s powerful and developer-led Homes UK agency. Meanwhile, Britain’s local government is in turmoil. Public services have been devastated by 11 years of austerity halving their budgets. The much-publicised cuts in care homes are the tip of an iceberg that includes police, youth services, older people and childcare, local transport, arts and museums. When confronted with this reality, “levelling up” by splurging on infrastructure is meaningless. The real threat to the north has long been the magnetism of the south, rather than a lack of public investment. I recently attended a meeting of business leaders in Manchester at which the overwhelming cry had nothing to do with infrastructure or HS2. It was: “Why can’t the south stop stealing our best young people?” A truly radical levelling-up agenda would ban new greenfield housing in the south, pleasing Tory voters and making house-buying there even more expensive. Southern flight should be discouraged by waiving student loans for all graduates who work in the north. Every penny of cultural and skills investment should go north for a decade. Move the Royal Opera to Manchester and the National Theatre to Leeds. Dump the House of Lords in York. Drive HS2 north from Birmingham, not south from it. Put London’s Crossrail into mothballs. The reality is that levelling up the north can only work with levelling down the south. The answer to northern decline lies in the re-empowerment of its cities, which long ago helped revive the fortunes of industrial Germany and France. A relentless hollowing out of local democracy has been the defining feature of the Cameron-May-Johnson years. Gove has been given a truly radical opportunity. But his motto should not be “take back control”; it should be “give back control”. Will he do it?

28|Crossrail looks pristine but opening may be delayed for two years|2019-12-26|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/26/elizabeth-line-looks-pristine-but-opening-may-be-delayed-for-two-years|A  year has passed already since the Elizabeth line was due to be opened by the Queen. Cutting the ribbon on  Crossrail , renamed in her honour, will not happen in 2020 either: another 15-24 months at least will pass before passengers can board its trains traversing London. Yet below the capital’s streets, the new railway looks all but ready. Individual stations are virtually done. Just off Oxford Street, the display screens of Tottenham Court Road’s new western ticket hall count down the departures of a parallel universe: trains every three minutes eastbound to Abbey Wood or Shenfield, and to Reading or Heathrow in the west. In place are the barriers, escalators, steel lights, even the big screens for artwork and advertising. All that is missing are the passengers and the trains. At the bottom of the escalators – just shorter than London’s most vertiginous at Angel tube – the completed platforms are vast and silent, ready for use by 170,000 passengers daily. “This is my favourite view on Crossrail,” says Lih-Ling Highe, the site manager for Tottenham Court Road, looking eastbound along the only curved platform on the railway. The Crossrail station at Whitechapel.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian As the far end of the 235-metre platform gracefully arcs out of sight in the distance, only a few workers in orange hi-vis protective gear are dotted around, a further walk from another soul than usually possible in the heart of London. The floor-to-ceiling safety screens separating waiting passengers and trains are still pristine; the walls and platform spotless, despite the tunnel having recently been smoked out to test the emergency extractor fans. Beyond, even the gold-leaf artwork on the eastern ticket hall ceiling has been painted. But, as the Crossrail chief executive, Mark Wild, admitted to a London assembly hearing last week: “If you go to Tottenham Court Road and Farringdon they are impressive developments; you think they look ready to go. “But behind the mask there is a lot of integration work to do ... It’s complex work and we can’t take any shortcuts.” Crossrail route Rewriting the software that links the various signalling systems is an overarching unknown. Wild is waiting for more clarity before announcing a fresh target opening date in January. If the latest iteration is good enough, Wild said trial running of trains – normally a nine-to-12-month process – could proceed quickly enough for the Elizabeth line to open under central London in spring 2021. Even at Whitechapel, one of two stations significantly behind schedule and over budget (by a staggering 500% to £659m) the subterranean Crossrail elements verge on completion: crucially, with an emergency exit for train crew. That will allow test trains to stop and enable Whitechapel – unlike the further delayed Bond Street – to open with the rest of Crossrail. Above ground, work continues on a new station concourse that passes over the two other railways to reach the escalators to the Elizabeth line. Whitechapel was a notorious interchange even before Crossrail: the only place where the overground is below the underground. Hemmed in by schools, pubs, flats and businesses, Crossrail had to build a new Whitechapel entrance and ticket hall for the duration, along with another shed to house a concrete mixing plant and two gantry cranes, to minimise disturbance. Crossrail workers on site at the Whitechapel station in East London.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian Jim Forrest, the site manager, says it will all be ready before Crossrail is done: underneath board and foam cladding are the tiles and handrails that give the look of a finished station. What is visible is a fraction of the work done, he says: “What you don’t see is the thousands of miles of communications cables and wirings installed.” Complex systems link each lightbulb and element to a control centre in Romford and are engineered to safety levels most passengers would be unaware of. Every glass-reinforced concrete panel lining the tunnels has dimples for acoustics and is doubly attached with hidden steel lanyards: “So they don’t fly off if there’s a blast. It’s all there.” Delays are not only frustrating for the commuters crammed into the Central line and other transport services still taking the strain: it threatens to unravel London’s finances. Plans such as a walking and cycling bridge, the rebuilding of Camden station, and the Piccadilly line signalling upgrades have been paused. The new Tottenham Court Road Crossrail station.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian Tony Travers, the director of LSE London, says: “Every day it takes longer, it costs more money – and every day it denies  TfL  the fare income. So they’re losing twice.” In TfL’s business plan, updated last week, “you can start to see the true horror of the losses”, Travers says – some £1.35bn over four years. As well as upgrades, cherished policies will disappear, he predicts. “It’s almost inconceivable that Sadiq Khan [the mayor of London] will extend the fares freeze ... TfL needs every farthing it can get.” At Whitechapel, we stumble on a member of the assurance team angrily grappling with an imperfect door Despite the pressure, and whatever the delays and cost overruns, Wild and the managers’ focus is clearly on getting it completely right before delivery. At the station level, much of the work remaining underground is “snagging”. At Whitechapel, we stumble on a member of the assurance team angrily grappling with an imperfect door, whose handles and locks are in the wrong place. At Tottenham Court Road, cladding has been removed to readjust the bolts on a screen: tight enough to hold all in place but not at the optimal specification for the part. “It’s that level of assurance and attention to detail to make sure everything is absolutely right,” Highe says. Crossrail has fallen from grace after the boastful overconfidence of previous executives – but optimism remains. Highe shows a secret bit of extra tunnel between the platforms of Tottenham Court Road, needed in construction but redundant for now. Rather than fill it in, they kept it behind closed doors: it may well, she says, prove useful in the construction of Crossrail 2.

29|‘Trading is gambling, no doubt about it’ – how cryptocurrency dealing fuels addiction|2022-01-15|https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/15/trading-is-gambling-no-doubt-about-it-how-cryptocurrency-dealing-fuels-addiction|"Steven has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever own. Raised on the remote Shetland archipelago, he left school at 13 to become a trawlerman before moving into construction, eventually earning £85,000 a year digging tunnels for Crossrail. Despite his self-made success, compulsive cryptocurrency trading, alcohol and drug use took over his life. In the fog of multiple addictions, he lost the “addresses” of between five and 10 bitcoins, rendering his digital buried treasure – worth up to £300,000 today – impossible to retrieve. Q&A What is cryptocurrency?  Show Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous. If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the  blockchain . Bitcoin  was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, sometimes surging in value as investors have piled in – and occasionally crashing back down. Dogecoin – which started as a joke – has also seen  a stratospheric rise in value . Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists, while libertarian monetarists enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank. The whole concept of cryptocurrencies has been criticised for its ecological impact, with ""mining"" for new coins requiring  vast energy reserves and the associated carbon footprint  of the whole system. Richard Partington  and  Martin Belam Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Steven spotted the potential of bitcoin early and he had a talent for trading. But even if he had that money now, his addiction means it would soon be squandered. “Trading is gambling, there’s no doubt about it,” he says. “I studied and studied. I taught myself how to be a good trader and tried really hard to manage my accounts and stick to a set of rules. .css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;} “But my mind would twist and I’d go all in, like a poker player that thought he had the perfect hand. I was convinced I was going to be a bitcoin millionaire.” Now in recovery at the Castle Craig residential treatment clinic in Scotland, Steven fears that legions of young people are being lured into high-risk trading and potentially addiction, based on the same misguided quest for untold riches. “A whole generation think that with a little mobile phone they can win, that they can … beat the market,” he says. “It scares the bejesus out of me.” Representation of cryptocurrency dogecoin.  Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters Steven’s fears are founded partly on crypto’s rapid emergence into the mainstream. When he started investing in 2015, digital currencies meant nothing to most people. Now, they are being touted as a more democratic alternative to a monopolistic and exploitative global financial system. As the Guardian revealed on Friday today,  crypto firms launched a record-breaking promotional push in London last year , targeting millions of commuters with 40,000 adverts on billboards, at tube stations, in carriages and across the side of double decker buses. Advertisers included relatively obscure names such as Hex, Kraken and Puglife about whom consumers know little, if anything. Meanwhile,  football clubs and players , not to mention globally recognised celebrities, tout crypto investments on a daily basis via social media. This week, reality TV star Kim Kardashian West and boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr were  named in a lawsuit  alleging that they helped promote crypto firm EthereumMax, as it made “false and misleading” statements that left investors nursing heavy losses. Investors sue Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr over crypto scheme Read more An Instagram post about EthereumMax, to Kardashian’s 250 million followers, may have been the most widely seen financial promotion of all time, according to the head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Yet despite their ascendancy – and warnings that governments  could suffer “limitless” losses  – cryptoassets remain unregulated in the UK, pending a Treasury review. That means that the FCA, the UK’s financial regulator, is all but powerless to influence how the industry behaves. While some trading platforms that offer digital assets are regulated – because they also offer more traditional financial instruments – crypto coins and tokens are not. Cryptoasset executives do not have to prove that they are fit and proper people to take people’s money. The companies they run are not required to hold enough cash to repay investors if they go bust. Nor must they worry about the FCA’s stipulation that financial promotions, such as those splashed across public transport in London, are fair, clear and not misleading. Amid the marketing blitz, the Advertising Standards Authority is the only watchdog that has bared its teeth. It is  investigating one advert  by the cryptocurrency Floki Inu and has already  banned one for Luno Money . A cryptocurrency poster advert at a London tube station.  Photograph: Gavin Rodgers/Alamy “If you’re seeing bitcoin on a bus, it’s time to buy,” the Luno advert insisted, contrary to prevailing investment wisdom. Arsenal adverts for cryptocurrency ‘fan tokens’ banned Read more Luno Money told the Guardian it would welcome an “effective regulatory framework”. But in the ongoing vacuum of oversight, experts fear that cautionary tales of addiction, such as the one told by Steven, are being drowned out by powerful, overwhelmingly positive messages. To monitor the type of messaging sent out by marketing teams, the Guardian created an experimental cryptocurrency portfolio – holding a mixture of bitcoin, ether and Shiba Inu. As bitcoin  slumped towards the end of 2021  and into 2022, having reached  all-time highs just weeks earlier , the Twitter account of smartphone trading app eToro remained doggedly optimistic. “Is bitcoin on its way to a new high?,” it asked, as the slide began. “We’ve seen bitcoin rally before. But could this be the one to take it to the MOON?” The answer, for the time being at least, was “No”. But holders of crypto portfolios were encouraged to stay positive. “Your account gained 1.87% yesterday,” one app notification read, as the slump abated. “You had a good day. Share the news with everyone.” No such invitation appeared on the far more frequent days when the value of the Guardian’s portfolio went down. “It’s a very strategic marketing ploy,” says Dr Anna Lembke, one of the world’s foremost addiction experts, professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of the book Dopamine Nation. “They’re encouraging you to amplify the wins and ignore the losses, creating a false impression there are more wins.” Asked about this, eToro says that it is “committed to helping retail investors engage with each other and foster an environment of learning and collaboration”, adding that its platform is not “gamified”. According to eToro’s UK managing director, Dan Moczulski, some users make their account public so that “all investments are visible to others, whether they are profitable or not”. The company said it also provides educational tools, performs know-your-customer checks and encourages long-term, diversified investing. But Dr Lembke is concerned by the potential for the social media element to fuel compulsive behaviour in crypto trading, an activity she says bears the hallmarks of addictive gambling products but without the acknowledged risk. “When you mix social media with financial platforms, you make a new drug that’s even more potent,” she says. Social media posts pushing crypto frequently refer to Fomo – the fear of missing out – fuelling an urge to participate. “You get this herd mentality where people talk to each other about what the market is doing, they have wins together, losses together, … an intense shared emotional experience.” “We get a little spike in dopamine, followed by a little deficit that has us looking to recreate that state.” This, she says, echoes characteristics of gambling but with a crucial difference. “It’s less stigmatised,” she says. “It has this socially sanctioned status as something that maverick smart people do.” Parallels with gambling are becoming harder to ignore. GamCare, which runs the National Gambling Helpline , said it fields about 20 calls a week related to crypto. Callers reported trading for 16 hours a day, making huge losses and struggling to cope with the guilt. As with gambling, where every one addict is estimated to harm seven other people, many were suffering at the hands of someone else’s habit. One recounted how her partner’s trading obsession was leading them to spend time away from the family. Another said their partner had taken to trading while in recovery from alcoholism, spending every waking hour making trades. GamCare has even dealt with young patients who bought digital coins in a desperate attempt to make enough money to get on to the property ladder, only to lose life-changing sums. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  At Castle Craig, where Steven is receiving treatment, the first crypto addict arrived at the clinic in 2016, followed by more than 100 since then. “More and more people are isolated and are doing this [trading], especially since Covid,” says Tony Marini, the senior specialist therapist at the clinic and a recovering gambling addict himself. “It’s tenfold already since 2016, so what’s it going to be like in the next five years?” Topics Cryptocurrencies Gambling Commodities Stock markets Technology sector Bitcoin news Reuse this content"|1

I am standing barefoot in a shallow pool in Europe’s largest coastal habitat restoration project,  Wallasea Island in Essex . The 670-hectare (1,656-acre) expanse of salt marshes, lagoons and mudflats was formed  using more than 3m tonnes  of London clay excavated from the Crossrail tunnel network,  almost half  of the waste material from the entire project. In the heat, crowds of flamingos would not feel out of place, but the sweltering temperature is a gnawing reminder of how rising sea levels and the climate crisis will threaten the UK’s coastline. The problem is so grave that one Dutch government scientist has even proposed a  295-mile (475km) dam of the North Sea  to protect large parts of western Europe. But projects such as Wallasea Island Wild Coast are a far less expensive, natural alternative to managing the rising water. Salt marshes are natural buffers against the wrath of the sea –  especially in storm surge conditions  – dramatically reducing wave height and soil erosion, as mangrove swamps do in tropical regions. Salt marshes around the UK provide  £1bn worth of coastal flood defences , according to one government report. Yet salt marshes themselves are also threatened if they cannot rise with the sea, as is the wildlife they support. Estuary haven ... the RSPB’s Wallasea Island nature reserve at high tide.  Photograph: David Wootton/RSPB At Wallasea Island, Malcolm Ausden, a principal ecologist with the Royal Society for the Protection of  Birds  (RSPB), is sorting through the saline sludge in his green wellies. “Here’s one,” he says, pointing out a bright red non-biting midge larva in his sieve. While only a limited number of species thrive in the multicoloured mud, the shrimps, cockles, insect larvae and young fish species found in the water support thousands of birds throughout the year. Salt marshes and mudflats sequester large quantities of carbon, so that’s helpful in terms of the climate crisis Malcolm Ausden, RSPB Avocets and little egrets wade in the shallows of the 22 lagoons and 67 islands in the project, which has been constructed on reclaimed farmland. Gulls, terns, plovers, buntings and many other species thrive in the Martian, treeless landscape, an unlucky few picked off by peregrine falcons, marsh harriers and kestrels. Hares sprint for cover in the grass meadows that border lagoons. As we continue our walk around the reserve, we stop at a Scandinavian-style shelter, close to the final resting place of Charles Darwin’s Beagle, which lies under the mud in the River Roach. Boats tack past as a handful of seals bask on the opposite bank, conspicuously orange from the iron oxide in the coastal mud. On the southern flank of the nature reserve, a crumbling sea wall holds back the estuary from the protected area. The RSPB controls the levels of the lagoons inside the reserve using a system of sluices. The long-term challenge is rising water levels that might one day overwhelm the sea wall. “If these old sea walls failed, it would massively increase the volume of water flowing in and out of the estuary on each tide, and this would put additional pressure on other sections of sea walls. The wetland creation scheme at Wallasea prevents this from happening, and so helps provide a long-term flood defence solution for the whole estuary,” Ausden says, explaining the importance of clawing back some of the thousands of hectares of intertidal salt marsh that once lined the Essex coast. These ecosystems are already part of any serious chef’s kitchen:  Maldon sea salt  is produced further up the coast. Fragile perimeter ... sea defences at Wallasea Island, Essex.  Photograph: Andy Hay/RSPB “Salt marshes and mudflats sequester large quantities of carbon, so that’s helpful in terms of the climate crisis,” says Ausden. “Also, salt marshes in front of sea walls reduce wave action on the sea wall, so they reduce that pressure and help reduce flood risk. And salt marshes provide nursery areas for commercially important fish.” You cannot put a sea wall everywhere. The other option is to try and live with sea level rise Prof Benjamin Horton The nature reserve at Wallasea Island is still young, with groundwork on shaping the excavated material from the 26 miles of tunnel for the  Crossrail  project having only been completed in 2015. A 180-metre temporary jetty was built at the site to receive 2,400 shiploads of soil and load it on to an 800-metre conveyor system to distribute around the reserve. By 2025, the scheme hopes to have created 150 hectares of mudflats, 90 hectares of salt marsh and 165 hectares of shallow saline lagoons that are controlled by barriers to regulate the tidal flow in and out of the protected area. Yet, while the Wallasea Island project is a leading example of a nature-based solution with active human management of the landscape, the scale of the challenge in the rest of the UK is daunting. Salt marshes are found along the Bristol Channel, the Wash, the Thames, the Firth of Forth and other big estuaries and are a vital transitional habitat between the land and ocean. But if they cannot rise at the same rate as the seas, they could disappear, making tidal marshes among the Earth’s most vulnerable ecosystems. In 2018, a study warned that  marshland in south-east England could disappear by 2040  if the climate crisis was allowed to continue. If the world sticks to  the Paris agreement , the ecosystems survive. One for the birds ... dark-bellied brent geese take flight from a grazing field at the RSPB reserve.  Photograph: Terry Whittaker/2020Vision/NPL/Alamy Prof Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore and lead author of the 2018paper, said the tipping point appeared to be when the annual rise in sea level reaches 6-7mm, after which salt marshes will drown. “They may try and go landward. But if you’ve got urban squeeze, there are roads and agricultural lands and ditches and dikes, they’ve got nowhere to go,” Horton explains, detailing the huge future cost of tidal defences to cities such as London and Singapore. 'The losses could be profound': floods wreak havoc on wildlife Read more “You cannot put a sea wall everywhere. The other option is to try and live with sea level rise. So this is where the marshes come in, they protect from erosion, they’ll absorb coastal waves. “You have areas where you let the water in and you live with it – Amsterdam, Venice; there are many, many such examples of that.

31|Crossrail delays will cost TfL up to £1.35bn in lost revenue|2019-12-13|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/13/crossrail-delays-cost-tfl-london-up-to-135bn-lost-revenue|Delays to  Crossrail  will cost London up to £1.35bn in lost ticket revenue, according to the capital’s transport authority. The shortfall in fare income will put further stress on  Transport  for London’s finances after the central government grant of about £700m a year was ended in 2018. The opening of the £18bn Elizabeth line, as the completed Crossrail project will be known, is now  expected in 2021 , at least two years behind schedule and billions of pounds over its original £14.8bn budget. TfL also warned that there were recent signs of lower passenger demand for public transport, possibly due to wider economic uncertainty, that could further threaten its income. However, TfL said it was still on track to run an operating surplus by 2022-23, with cost-cutting in its everyday operations saving more than £1bn annually. It said it would continue investment in public transport, walking and cycling. But while some upgrades to the tube will go ahead, TfL said plans to overhaul the “life-expired“ signalling on the Piccadilly line, a major artery across  London  to Heathrow airport, could not restart without central government funding. The last government spending round made no commitment to any funds for TfL. Timeline Crossrail - two decades of delays and rising costs Show November 2000   The study into the possible London East West route is published. January 2002   Cross London Rail Links Limited is set up as a joint venture between the Strategic Rail Authority and Transport for London (TFL). 27 October 2003     -     3 December 2003   Public consultation on the preferred route is held. June 2004   The government announces the go-ahead for Crossrail. July 2008   Four years later, and after further public consultation, the Crossrail Hybrid Bill finally passes through parliament. May 2009   Construction starts. January 2014   National Audit Office declares that the Crossrail programme is on schedule. March 2014   The extension of the route to Reading is announced. May 2015   Tunnelling work is declared finished. TFL takes over the running of the Liverpool Street to Shenfield mainline services which will form the eastern part of the route. February 2016   It is announced that the route will officially be called the Elizabeth Line when it opens. May 2017   The first tests of the new trains are delayed. June 2017   The first of the new trains enter service between Liverpool Street and Shenfield. 24 January 2018   Crossrail is forced to reveal that it is running 20% over budget, but says it will still open by the end of the year. May 2018   Tfl starts running services from Paddington to Heathrow, which will form part of the western end of the final Crossrail service. July 2018   Government approves additional funding, increasing the total budget from £14.8bn to £15.4bn. August 2018   Crossrail announces that there will be a year delay in opening, with services through the tunnelled London section expected to open in autumn 2019. 8 November 2019   Further delays and a rise in costs to £18bn are announced - with the aim for Crossrail to open “as soon as practically possible in 2021”. 21 August 2020   Yet another delay is announced , as TfL say a temporary pause in construction and ensuing slowdown due to Covid-19 distancing requirements has only partially contributed to another cost overrun of £450m. The line will not now open before 2022. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “I am hugely proud of what we have achieved improving transport across London – this is despite the ongoing economic uncertainty and the average reduction of £700m per year in TfL’s funding from central government. “But London also needs a government that recognises the importance of continued investment in new infrastructure for the future of our economy, and it is essential the new government commits to working with us to deliver vital projects such as  Crossrail  2 and the Bakerloo line extension.” The TfL commissioner, Mike Brown, said he was working urgently to secure “steady, sustained funding in existing and new infrastructure” from the new government. Crossrail remains TfL’s biggest headache, with delays adding significant additional capital investment and revenue pressures, the transport authority said. On Sunday one small milestone will be passed as TfL takes over the running of services to Reading from Paddington, a future western branch of the Elizabeth line. Although many stations are near completion, Crossrail confirmed last month it would need more time to finish the signalling software, as well as months of testing that ruled out opening the central, underground section next year. It is now due to open “as soon as practically possible in 2021”. That delay would spell an additional £500m and £750m in lost revenue for TfL over the next four years, on top of £600m already accounted for in the business plan issued in December 2018 when the first delays were known. TfL will also partially fund the  escalating construction costs  of Crossrail. Topics Crossrail Transport London Rail transport Rail industry news Reuse this content|1
32|Crossrail faces further delays and will cost more than £18bn|2019-11-08|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/08/crossrail-faces-further-delays-and-will-cost-more-than-18bn-tfl|Crossrail will not open until at least 2021, incurring a further cost overrun that will take the total price of the London rail link to more than £18bn,  Transport  for London (TfL) has announced. The latest assessment for the opening of the central section has ruled out late 2020 and the aim is for  Crossrail  to open “as soon as practically possible in 2021”, the capital’s transport authority said. TfL had previously said the Elizabeth line, as the service will be called, was unlikely to start running before 2021 but had kept an autumn 2020 opening in its plans. The admission means that key direct services such as from Canary Wharf to Heathrow airport will almost certainly not run until at least 2022. The latest delay was caused by the need for more time to develop signalling software and to get safety approvals for the railway.

The line will not now open before 2022. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The cost forecast for the central section of the line has risen to about £15.36bn – £400m more than the funding committed under a financing package agreed with the government. “Further modelling scenarios” suggest higher levels of risk to the project that would cost an extra £650m,  TfL  said. Crossrail is Britain’s biggest infrastructure project in decades. The total cost was previously estimated at £17.6bn but has risen to as much as £18.25bn, from an initial budget of £14.8bn. UK railways cannot cope with climate crisis, says rail boss Read more TfL said it had agreed with the Department for Transport that the financing package would stay in place and was talking to the department about how to cover the extra costs. “TfL has been advised by Crossrail Ltd that their latest assessment is that the opening of the central section will not occur in 2020, which was the first part of the previously declared opening window,” TfL said. “The Elizabeth line will open as soon as practically possible in 2021.” Crossrail was due to open in December 2018  but has been beset by delays and rising costs. The National Audit Office has blamed the debacle on  management clinging to an unrealistic opening date  instead of dealing with problems that appeared as early as 2015. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said: “We are doing everything we can to complete the Elizabeth line as quickly as we can but there are no shortcuts to delivering this hugely complex railway. The Elizabeth line must be completed to the highest safety and quality standards.” crossrail map Changes to design and schedules increased costs on most of the project’s 36 main contracts. The costs of civil engineering works at Whitechapel station alone, as of December 2018, were £659m – six times the amount originally budgeted and more than double the estimate in 2015. London politicians and business groups reacted with dismay. Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat assembly member, said it was “appalling news for Londoners” and said both the mayor and the transport secretary had failed to hold Crossrail to account. She said the delay would also “put back further investment in London’s transport network and create further havoc to TfL’s finances. This also damages the hopes of Crossrail 2 getting started in the next decade.” Business group London First said it was “very disappointing”. Its chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: “Efforts must be redoubled to ensure that the railway opens as soon as practically possible and that we learn the lessons for future projects.” Crossrail is on track for one impending milestone, with the full western branch out to Reading from Paddington due to come into service under TfL Rail on 15 December.

33|Cycling brands gear up for rapid growth in UK cargo bike market|2021-07-24|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/24/cycling-brands-gear-up-for-rapid-growth-in-uk-cargo-bike-market|Window cleaners, milk deliverers, beer purveyors,  plumbers  and  DJs  are all getting on their bikes as UK government incentives and new infrastructure kick off a two- and three-wheel revolution. About 2,000 cargo bikes were sold in the UK for commercial use last year, according to the Bicycle Association, and a similar number were sold for use by families and individuals. Sales of the bikes, which can carry heavy or bulky loads, are expected to jump by up to 60% in the UK in the year ahead, according to the association, boosted by various initiatives at local and national level to reduce carbon emissions and congestion. Raleigh, one of the world’s biggest bike brands, launched its first electric cargo bikes this week, and the company’s UK managing director, Lee Kidger, predicts that the UK market for these cycle workhorses will soar to 15 times its current level within five years. The Nottingham-based firm only began selling cargo bikes a few years ago but sales spiked 75% last year. Kidger points to Germany, where about 100,000 cargo bikes are sold every year, and France, where 50,000 are sold a year, as examples of their potential in the UK. “The last 16 months has changed people’s habits and life forever. We are at a crossroads and if we act now we can really support change for a more sustainable future,” Kidger said. E-cargobikes expects to be using more than 1,500 bikes by April 2023.  Photograph: E-cargobikes The company has teamed up with London dairy Jones Bros, which has  used the Raleigh bikes  to trial deliveries to its city centre clients, and the National Trust, which is using the bikes to transport supplies and staff around 11 large sites. Raleigh is going up against established cargo bike specialists including Christiania, Tern and Babboe, which is owned by Raleigh’s parent company, Accell Group. Perhaps one of the biggest and most visible shifts towards cargo bikes, however, could come in grocery delivery. James FitzGerald, co-founder of specialist logistics group E-cargobikes, says the company, which currently operates about 50 bikes in London carrying out several thousand deliveries a week for the Co-op and others, expects to have more than 1,500 bikes by April 2023. The company has worked with more than one major supermarket to develop its own cargo bike, the first of which will be produced in the UK later this year. In the future, it aims to replace electric vans for home deliveries of groceries. “It’s faster, easier and cheaper,” he says. “The opportunity is massive.” Development is gathering pace partly thanks to the government’s £250m investment in walking and cycling infrastructure. The Energy Saving Trust’s £2m fund in England last year, and more loans and grants in Scotland to help businesses and local authorities purchase cargo bikes, are being backed up by a variety of local grants and incentives in towns and cities, such as Nottingham, Coventry and Cambridge. The National Trust is using cargo bikes at 11 of its sites.  Photograph: James Dobson/National Trust Images In an effort to combat congestion and pollution, London and other cities are creating local delivery hubs, where vans can drop large amounts of goods that can then be picked up and delivered by bike. Demand for lower-carbon deliveries from both consumers and businesses with environmental targets to hit is also driving the market. Amazon has already teamed up with the City of London to create an e-bike hub, while Henry Jones from Jones Bros says the company is planning to take on up to four cargo bikes that it hopes to use to deliver its products from hubs at the edge of the city. “We are going back to what we did 100 years ago,” said Jones. “One of the big benefits is that a lot of our delivery fleet can’t get inside the M25 [because of pollution or congestion charges]. Cargo bikes can and customers get a better service.” Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, says research for  Transport  for London found that up to 14% of small van journeys could be made with bikes instead, particularly in congested parts of the city. Transport for London has been working on  trials with construction companies  including Sir Robert McAlpine, Morgan Sindall and FM Conway to use cargo bikes instead of vans to deliver some tools and smaller equipment into major projects such as Crossrail and HS2. “It feels like we are on the cusp of a revolution. It saves time and money and it is better for the environment,” Norman said. Topics Travel & leisure Transport Cycling news Reuse this content|1
34|Harry Barrow obituary|2021-03-31|https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/31/harry-barrow-obituary|My grandad, Henry Barrow, known as Harry, who has died aged 95, was a mechanical engineer and expert in heat transfer who spent more than three decades at the  University of Liverpool . His work made a major contribution to the science of tunnel cooling. Born in Liverpool, the younger child of Catherine (nee Boyd) and her husband, James Barrow, a bakery packer, Harry attended Oulton high school and was the first person in his family to go to university, graduating from the University of Liverpool in 1944 with a first-class honours degree in marine engineering. Harry served in the engineering branch of the Royal Navy from 1944 to 1947, first in Portsmouth and then in the Mediterranean. On his return to the UK in 1947, he married Christina O’Brien, who had grown up a few streets away from him in Fairfield, Liverpool. They went on to have two children, Stephen and Janet. Henry undertook further practical training at Vickers-Armstrongs in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, before teaching at Liverpool Technical College. In 1951, he was appointed as a lecturer in the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Liverpool. Following the completion of his PhD, he was promoted to senior lecturer in 1964 and then to reader in 1979. He published more than 90 articles in scientific journals during his career. Harry retired in 1984, but continued to teach part-time in the department of engineering until 1987. On retirement, Harry found a new focus for his expertise. Development work on the Channel tunnel had highlighted the need to mitigate thermal problems in long railway tunnels, both for safety and for passenger comfort. Working with Clive Pope, an expert in train aerodynamics, over the next 20 years he made a major contribution to the science of tunnel cooling, receiving funding from British Rail, Crossrail and Mott MacDonald. In recognition of his scholarship, he was awarded a doctorate of engineering by Liverpool University in 2005. Despite research success, Harry was committed to teaching and maintained lifelong contact with his former PhD students. Outside work, Grandad enjoyed oil painting and watching snooker, rugby and football, but, even in his later years, he could often be found sitting in his chair writing equations and theorising. He also delighted in sharing his experiments – and magic tricks – with each new generation of the family. Christina died in 2012. He is survived by their children, his grandchildren, Lois, Louise, Samuel and me, and great-grandchildren, Harry, James, Sophia, and Joanna.

MPs from all sides have  accused Boris Johnson of whipping up political poison  after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was set upon by protesters who accused him of protecting the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded him near parliament with shouts of “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. The former chief whip Julian Smith described the events as appalling and said the prime minister’s false Savile slurs must be “withdrawn in full”. Johnson said the behaviour directed at Starmer was “absolutely disgraceful” and “completely unacceptable” but once again stopped short of apologising. 01:36 Anti-vax protesters shouting false Savile slurs target Keir Starmer – video Johnson is expected to reshuffle his team today including possibly sacking the chief whip, Mark Spencer. The prime minister will also continue a No 10 overhaul after recruiting Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, as his chief of staff, and Guto Harri, his former spokesperson, as his new director of communications. Harri has drawn criticism from Labour over his  previous job for a lobbying firm  that worked for Huawei, the company linked to the Chinese Communist party that has been banned from the UK’s 5G mobile network. Diplomacy but no detente –  Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin had nothing in the way of a breakthrough to show for  five hours of talks at the Kremlin on the Russia-Ukraine crisis . Macron, the French president, is due today in Kyiv to hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has met with Joe Biden at the White House. Biden insisted the  Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline  from Russia to Germany would be shut down if Russia attacked, but Scholz would not be so specific. Biden said of Putin: “I know that he’s in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv. He has the capacity to do that. What he’s going to do I don’t know.” The president advised US civilians to leave Ukraine, saying: “I don’t want them to get caught in the crossfire.” As the  Russian build-up continues , Britain has agreed to  send a further 350 troops to Poland . Over-18 checks on porn sites –  British users of pornography websites would have to provide  credit card or passport details to prove they are over 18  under revived plans. Ministers have said the forthcoming online safety bill will cover commercial porn sites, updating draft legislation that now applies to providers of user-generated pornography such as OnlyFans. More than a third of the British population are estimated to watch online pornography, according to estimates by the age verification industry, meaning age checking could be both an enormous technical challenge and potentially big business. High street faces hit –  Britain’s biggest retailers have warned the cost of living crisis will mean  consumers tightening their purse strings  over the coming months. Households already grappling with rising energy bills, petrol prices, tax, mortgage payments and rent can also expect to pay more for groceries this year. Supermarkets are responding by cutting back on staff costs; squeezing farmers and other suppliers not to increase their prices; “shrinkflation” tactics such as  reducing the amount in a pack of peanuts  while keeping the price the same; and cutting out unnecessary product lines. And while it won’t solve the energy price crunch, thousands of homes could soon be  paid to halve their electricity usage during high-demand times . Octopus Energy and the National Grid are to trial the scheme. Toxins in tap water –  Drinking water containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals known as PFOS was  piped into the homes of more than 1,000 people  in south Cambridgeshire, the Guardian can reveal. The aquifer supplying the affected houses, close to Duxford airfield, was found to have PFOS levels at almost 400 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of water – four times the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s limit. Cambridge Water has admitted it removed the supply in June last year and said the exposure was under investigation. It admitted it had not told the community but said it had blended the water with another source. It would not say how long the villages had been drinking the contaminated supply, only that modelling and sampling undertaken in 2020 suggested the levels were previously below 100ng/l. PFOS has been associated with  increased cholesterol, low birthweight and suppressed immune response . In the past it was used in firefighting foams, including at airfields. Defra, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency declined to comment. Runs like it’s on rails –  The Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief has said, amid speculation that the £18.9bn Crossrail project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. As trials continue, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian’s transport correspondent, has taken a trip on the line,  riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street . View from the driver’s cab of an Elizabeth Line train.  Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian The official deadline for opening is the end of June. Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability. Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” Today in Focus podcast: Hooked on crypto With endorsements from celebrities and ads on TikTok, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream.

36|"Depleted and unwanted, HS2 hurtles on as Johnson’s £100bn vanity project | Simon Jenkins"|2021-07-30|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/30/hs2-johnson-vanity-cost-taxpayer|"B ritain’s new high-speed railway will not – repeat: not – get to the north of England. It will go back and forth from London to the Midlands and its chief beneficiaries will be London commuters. All else is political spin. This became certain last week as the government’s internal major projects authority declared phase two of the HS2 project, to Manchester and Leeds, effectively dead. While the already-started London-to-Birmingham stretch is still marked at “amber/red” for “successful delivery in doubt”,  anything north of Crewe  has been designated “unachievable”. Its multitudinous issues “do not appear to be manageable or resolvable”. This comes not from the arms-length  National Infrastructure Commission  or last winter’s  Oakervee report , both agreeing that going beyond Birmingham should be “reviewed”. This was the verdict of an arm of the Treasury and Cabinet Office. Since  HS2  has always been politics-driven – no rail strategy ever gave it priority – it has raced past every red light for a decade. By far Europe’s biggest infrastructure scheme, it has finally been overtaken by its own extravagance. The pandemic has sent commuter numbers plummeting and wrecked any remotely plausible rate of return. The only way of conveying the scale of Johnson’s vanity in this vanity project is to convey its opportunity cost, a  projected £106bn  (and rising) over 20 years. That is the  price of hundreds of new NHS hospitals  or thousands of new secondary schools. It is seven times the cost of the education Covid recovery project proposed last spring but rejected by Johnson as too costly. It is the same additional annual cost to 2040 as the projected  new social care scheme  – still considered too expensive. HS2 is in that spending league. These are real choices. This one train line will consume the equivalent of Britain’s entire projected railway investment budget during its two decades of construction. Even the initial phase to Birmingham, at roughly £70bn, is twice the £40bn cost of the “northern powerhouse” rail system, which every infrastructure pundit agrees should be built first. Yet that system is now in serious danger of being delayed or never completed. HS2 is a glaring “levelling-down” of the north. The railway’s route was projected as a nostalgic echo of Robert Stephenson’s first line from Euston to Birmingham, travelling between Birmingham’s as yet non-existent Curzon Street station and a Euston station that does not link with HS1 and the Channel tunnel (and is not even on the new Crossrail). No one boarding a train in the north will be able to travel directly to France. As for Curzon Street in Birmingham, it is a mile from the New Street interchange and the west coast main line. This makes absolutely no sense. Even Lord Adonis, for whom HS2 was the holy grail, accepts it should probably now stop at  Acton’s Old Oak Common hub . Meanwhile arguments,  some of them court cases , continue over the trains themselves. They are not planned to tilt, which means that any time saved on a new track to Birmingham will be lost on winding track further north. A re-signalled King’s Cross line could even get to Scotland faster. HS2 is more a  taxpayer-funded  theme park than a railway. The project has long been out of control.  It is a spending black hole : figures in 2018 showed its latest boss Mark Thurston having to be paid over £660,000 a year, with 15 of his colleagues on over £250,000. A quarter of all HS2 staff, over 300 people,  received above £100,000 . The Commons public accounts committee  declared it  to be “badly off course” and lacking even the most “basic financial controls.” This is despite the outlay of  £600m  annually on consultants, including  £35m on the “big four”  accountancy firms.  It is never too late to stop a dud project, but it requires ever more courage to do so. Not a mile of track has been laid – the only tunnels have been built  by Swampy . What is intriguing is how HS2 has mutated from from a transport project to political machismo – “infrastructure” that is good in itself. Like Johnson’s  garden bridges  and  crony PPE contracts , the more extravagant they are, the more they can be described as “world-beating”. A recent Institute for Government seminar on HS2 received a  devastating report  on this whole saga from Professor Stephen Glaister of Imperial College. A Whitehall official present was heard to reflect that, in the light of Covid constraints, the railway could forget any other serious investment. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, was an uncritical backer of HS2 when he thought it would get him fast to London. He will now find Birmingham blessed with cash that might have renovated his dire northern powerhouse rail network three times over – money he may now never see. Rishi Sunak claims to want to start saving, not spending. Yet as long as HS2 sits in his budget he is hamstrung. He cannot tell doctors, nurses or teachers that he “cannot afford” their desperate requests. If he can afford HS2, he can afford anything. The truth is that this staggering vanity project survives for one reason. It looks good from London.

37|Global firms expected to sue UK for coronavirus losses|2020-08-15|https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/aug/15/global-law-firms-expected-to-sue-uk-for-coronavirus-losses|Governments around the world – including the UK – face a wave of lawsuits from foreign companies who complain that their profits have been hit by the pandemic. Webinars and presentations shared with clients reveal that leading global law firms anticipate governments around the world will soon face claims over their response to the Covid-19 crisis. The actions are being brought under investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses which are embedded in trade and investment agreements and allow foreign investors and firms to sue other countries’ governments. The claims are heard in highly secretive ad hoc tribunals before a panel of three judges. Often it is not apparent that a case is being brought until the panel sits. The law firm Alston & Bird  used a recent webinar to predict  that the UK will be sued over Sadiq Khan’s decision to close Crossrail construction sites during the pandemic. The decision was at odds with the government’s policy of  allowing sites to operate throughout lockdown , an inconsistency that they say opens up the way for a legal challenge. Law firm  Reed Smith has  predicted that measures taken by governments to deal with the crisis are affecting investments “directly and significantly and could give rise to substantial claims”. And Ropes & Gray  has issued an alert  advising clients to consider actions brought under investment treaties as “a powerful tool to recover or prevent loss resulting from Covid-19-related government actions”. There are particular concerns about claims being brought against governments in the developing world. Cases could result in governments watering down   or withdrawing actions to tackle the pandemic for fear they will be sued Open letter More than  600 civil society groups  in 90 countries have written an open letter sounding the alarm. Signatories include Oxfam, Friends of the Earth, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), SumOfUs and Global Justice Now. They warn at a “time when government resources are stretched to the limit in responding to the crisis, public money should not be diverted from saving lives, jobs and livelihoods into paying ISDS awards or legal fees to fight a claim”. And they predict that a spate of cases now could result in a “regulatory chilling effect, in which governments water down, postpone or withdraw actions to tackle the pandemic for fear they will be sued”. Countries including El Salvador and Bolivia have allowed citizens to delay payments for services such as water and electricity. Law firm Hogan Lovells has  issued a client alert  suggesting that foreign-owned utility companies could sue for lost revenue in such cases. “Clearly, companies shouldn’t sue countries over emergency measures to save lives in a global pandemic, and we shouldn’t sign trade agreements that let them,” said Sondhya Gupta, UK campaign manager at SumOfUs. “We know lower-income countries are struggling most to contain the virus. The threat of rich corporations bullying them out of badly needed public funds to ‘compensate’ them for profit losses will further hamper efforts to fight the virus and add to the burden on future generations.” Jean Blaylock, campaigns and policy manager at Global Justice Now, said the corporate courts which heard the claims often made awards far higher than those made by national courts. Of the more than 1,000 ISDS cases known to have been brought before the pandemic, 13 resulted in awards or settlements of more than US$1bn. By the end of 2018, a raft of governments around the world had been ordered, or had agreed, to pay investors in publicly known ISDS cases a total of $88bn. But there are now concerns Covid-19 will spark a claims bonanza which will benefit major law firms both bringing and defending the claims. “We have already heard of the threat of a case in Peru where the government there ordered toll roads to stop collecting tolls,” Blaylock said. “The government was worried that the act of taking money could be a way of spreading the pandemic.” Blaylock added: “Why would a corporation sue? It seems so unreasonable, yet when you read the material from the law firms, to them it’s completely normal and they are expecting this to happen. They recognise there are incredibly valid public health needs, but they also understand that these courts are designed only to look at the interests of investors.” Topics Law The Observer Coronavirus Trade and development news Reuse this content|1

Whenever a gap opens up between plan and performance, the overwhelming tendency is to blame the managers/workers who “failed” to meet the target. In fact, the problem is often with overoptimistic, unrealistic plans in the first place. Crossrail is just one of many examples. The moral of the story also applies to major private sector corporations, which routinely set targets for the performance of all their staff, and even for their share prices. Yet most commentators report bad results as a “failure to meet analysts’ expectations”. The broader lesson of the NAO report is that we should focus as much on bad planning as on bad performance, in public projects and private business alike.

40|Crossrail hired security firm to monitor trade unionists|2019-07-29|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/revealed-crossrail-hired-security-firm-to-monitor-trade-unionists|Senior managers at  Crossrail , the huge publicly funded rail project in London, hired a corporate security company to monitor trade unionists who were campaigning against blacklisting across the construction industry, previously secret documents reveal. The managers paid £59,000 to the company, Control Risks, over three years. They said the monitoring of the trade unionists was part of work to protect the project from outside threats. The project to build a 73-mile east-west rail line across London is  funded by  the Department for Transport and Transport for London (TfL), the capital’s public transport authority. The documents show how the security company compiled weekly reports on the trade unionists who were seeking justice for blacklisted workers. Control Risks tracked their campaign, analysing their tactics and the impact of their protests. It identified influential figures in the anti-blacklisting campaign and its potential future activity. The trade unionists were supporting an electrician who said he had been blacklisted and sacked from the Crossrail project. In 2009, a watchdog closed down a blacklist funded by the construction industry containing files on thousands of workers they  deemed to be troublemakers . Trade unionists campaigned to get compensation for those who had been  denied jobs for long periods . Crossrail has denied  using blacklisting  on the project. Managers have been criticised for spending money on monitoring the trade unionists when their project has run almost  £3bn over budget  and its opening has been  heavily delayed . On the blacklist: how did the UK’s top building firms get secret information on their workers? Read more The decision to hire Control Risks would have been authorised by Chris Sexton, the project’s technical director until last year, according to TfL. He has  since been promoted  to be its deputy chief executive. The reports of the monitoring operation – codenamed Project Galahad – were sent to senior Crossrail executives. Control Risks was paid £47,857 in 2013 and £11,309 in 2010, according to TfL. In a statement, Crossrail said Control Risks had been hired “as part of its security planning … to assess external threats to the project, including, for example, terrorist threats, criminal threats and threats from direct action. “Control Risks identified information that was available publicly, analysed that information and produced reports on the information that was relevant to the Crossrail project.” This included information about allegations of blacklisting, it added. Control Risks said it “gathered information solely by looking at social media, websites and news reports. No interviews or on-the-ground information gathering took place.” It said work helped “Crossrail meet its duty-of-care obligation towards its employees”. Control Risks, founded in 1975, is one of the UK’s oldest private security companies. It styles itself as “ a specialist global risk consultancy ”, giving advice to large corporations, carrying out investigations and providing security to governments and security for companies. It is understood to recruit former spies and military personnel. Some documents about the monitoring were obtained by Frank Morris, the electrician, under the  Data Protection Act . Crossrail project dragged into blacklist scandal Read more With the support of the trade unionists, Morris campaigned to get his job back at the Crossrail project after he said he had been blacklisted and dismissed for voicing safety concerns. His claim was rejected by Crossrail, which said Morris was among 28 workers made redundant when a section of work had been completed. The documents obtained by Morris show Control Risks monitored him and other anti-blacklisting campaigners between May and September 2013, drawing on material on the internet. One exchange of emails show Crossrail asking Control Risks how many protesters were going to demonstrate at a court hearing at which Morris was taking legal action. Morris criticised the “mismanaged” Crossrail project for carrying out monitoring that was “wrong”. “Big business is spending large amounts of money to keep me under surveillance and deny me work,” he said. “It sounds like something from a Hollywood film but it’s actually the dirty hidden secret of much industrial relations in the UK today.” Topics Crossrail Trade unions Industrial action London news Reuse this content|1
41|Manchester mayor proposes ‘Crossrail-type’ railway for city|2019-07-19|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/19/manchester-mayor-proposes-crossrail-type-railway-for-city|The mayor of  Greater Manchester , Andy Burnham, has said Manchester should have an underground railway, as the cost of the delayed Crossrail project in London swelled to £17.6bn. Burnham proposed a “Crossrail for Manchester-type scenario” where new railway lines would be built under central  Manchester  to help people get across the increasingly gridlocked city. He made the remarks at an event about the future of rail in the north of England on Friday, as  MPs in Westminster lambasted  Crossrail’s delays and ballooning costs. A report  from the public accounts committee said Crossrail – which connects Reading in Berkshire with Shenfield in Essex through central London via 26 miles of new tunnels – is now expected to be delivered up to two years behind schedule and £2.8bn over budget. After London, Manchester has  the worst road congestion  in England, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, and Burnham believes creating a tube system under the city could be part of the solution. Burnham made the uncosted proposal as he pointed out that HS2, the new high-speed line from London that is supported by the Tory government and Labour, would run underground in the capital and its leafy suburbs – including  for 21.6km (13.4 miles) under fields in the Chilterns  – yet would bulldoze through central Manchester and large swathes of the north of England. Current plans for  HS2  envisage the new line tunnelling under eight miles of Greater Manchester from Manchester airport before emerging above ground at Manchester Piccadilly. Platforms will be 415 metres long, taking up valuable real estate. The station would expand further should Northern Powerhouse Rail – a new east-west link across the Pennines – get built. Leaders in the north say  an integrated underground option at Piccadilly could add £4bn to the Greater Manchester economy by 2035, while building above ground would “result in a sprawling train station in the heart of Manchester, slashing prime regeneration space”. Burnham said the result would turn “half of central Manchester into a railway station”. In London, Euston station will be remodelled vertically, with  11 underground platforms  for HS2. “The government always seems to run out of money by the time they reach the north,” said Burnham, who hopes to influence the design of the Manchester leg, which is not yet guaranteed to be built. He blamed London-centric decisionmakers for the Manchester station plans, which did not take account of future land values in the rapidly developing city. “Why are they trying to build HS2 on the surface here? The only answer I can give you is: because they can.” Earlier this week, MPs  overwhelmingly voted  to build HS2 as far as Crewe, considered the gateway to the north of England. But the future of the rest of the line is far from guaranteed. Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has drawn up plans for an independent review of HS2 if he enters Downing Street as expected next week. Luke Raikes, a senior research fellow at IPPR North, which hosted Friday’s event, said Burnham and other local leaders should have more say in transport planning: “An underground network may well be part of the solution for Greater Manchester, but regardless of which is the right option, the decisions about such investments should be made by accountable local politicians within Greater Manchester, not by remote officials in London.  “The evidence shows that central government does not invest strategically across the country, and that local areas are much better placed to make these decisions.” Topics Greater Manchester London versus … Andy Burnham Manchester Crossrail Transport HS2 Rail transport news Reuse this content|1
42|Boris Johnson’s much-criticised speech to the CBI, in full|2021-11-23|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full|B oris Johnson’s speech to the CBI has been called a “mess”, the “most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister” since his most recent  PMQs  performance. It is said to have capped off a “pretty bad bloody fortnight” and left the prime minister  struggling to command the confidence of his party . In it he referenced Peppa Pig, “funkapolitan” cafes and his time as motoring correspondent of GQ. Then he lost his place. So how bad was it? Here is the official transcript, judge for yourself: “Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business for keeping going, for looking after your employees, for rising to the challenge, for responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you – kitchen appliance makers, hairdryer makers,  Formula  One motorcar manufacturers – turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed, turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1% of our domestic needs to 80%. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, for producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because, without you, let’s face it , we would simply not be here. And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject can I ask: who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life; even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing – we can see the state of the pandemic abroad, the supply chain issues that we’re facing, the pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing, the skills shortages. But don’t forget, folks , my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12% unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you – thanks to the resilience of British business – we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century as we were forced to lock down the economy. Well, look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business  bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass  unemployment and the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today, which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems, to transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country, but also the imbalance between British business between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room and the long comet tail whose potential is, frankly, yet to be realised; that don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills, as Rishi the chancellor so often points out – that don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country : to unite and level up ; of this government , to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing but it is also an economic imperative. Because, if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and, if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can, and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And, today, fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first  Industrial  Revolution began 250 years ago, it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century, we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on Earth. And today, we are on the brink of another revolution : a green  industrial revolution. And again, there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today, I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution – provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life. But among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove Ferraris, Maseratis, Nissan Skylines, Proton Sagas. You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles : an extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways and I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40 – they’ve got a lot better. And when, a few years later, as mayor of London, I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But 10 years after that, the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70% a year. And, in 2030, we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs – ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north-east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and, together with Envision, there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago, the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And, of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that : 250 years after we launched the first Industrial Revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80% of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck; closed for being simply too polluting and good for nothing except the final shootout in gangster movies. But, in 2012, we were still 40% dependent on coal. Today, only 10 years later, coal supplies less than 2% of our power and, by 2024, it will be down to zero. And Battersea, of course, is a great  funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes, thanks to the vision of the former mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow – about the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal – I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking ‘right,  OK, maybe this is doable’. And, when I was a kid, literally 0% of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from  ninth-century Persia, I think. And yet, today, look at the coast of the north-east where we are today: row after row stretching out to the  North  Sea, of beautiful white mills, as we claim a new harvest rich and green from the drowned meadows of Doggerland. And, on some days, we derive almost half this country’s energy needs with the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like a new  Tesla. Because I can tell you, as a former motoring correspondent, EV s may not burble like sucking doves and they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love. But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch and, in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically our cars, our trucks, our buses, our ships, our boats, our planes, our trains, our domestic heating systems, our farming methods, our industrial processes, our power generation, and much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change, it won’t be government. And it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, the disciples of David Attenborough – not just in this country but around the world – who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that, in just a few years’ time, it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal-fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And, as the world reaches this pivotal moment post-Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because, in the end, it is you – it is businesspeople – who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate, governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And, though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, we know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market and in framing the right regulation.  And to ensure that you, the British business, succeeds in this new world, we have set out a 10-point plan for government leadership; a new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials, ‘the new  Ten  Commandments thou shalt develop’: 1.  Offshore wind 2.  Hydrogen 3.  Nuclear power 4.  Zero-emission vehicles 5.  Green public transport, cycling and walking 6. ‘ Jet zero’ and green ships 7.  Greener buildings 8.  Carbon capture and storage 9.  Nature and trees 10.  Green finance And for each of those objectives, we are producing a roadmap so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen and the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90bn of private sector investment, driving the creation of high-wage, high-skill jobs across the UK as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country – not just in the green  Industrial  Revolution, of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you and to build the platform to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy, fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation if we are going to have, allow our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high-energy intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment” so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail – last week we announced three vast new high-speed lines, cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour and creating a new Crossrail of the North, cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes, a Crossrail for the Midlands, cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade and to electrify; you have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out, sadly, in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well, you have to put in clean buses, you have to improve – 4,000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And, of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital, there are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I prophesy that people will come back, Tony, they will come to the office and they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice and that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7% when I became PM to 65% at the beginning of next year. And, with safer streets, with great local schools, with fantastic broadband … [Lost it] [Uhhh] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] … people will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up to start business and business will have the confidence to invest. And then, of course, there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, far more than broadband, and that is skills and the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16- to 18-year-olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills; investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And, since – as everybody knows – 80% of the 2030 workforce are already in work, we are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level-three skill – £3,000 for a lifetime skills guarantee .  We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And, at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms to deliver freeports, as well as free trade deals, and to regulate differently and better to lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century : AI, cyber, quantum computing and all the rest – and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ad tech, green tech. So you sound basically like 15th-century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing. There are only three countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns. And they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which, which three nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? [Audience-member: The United States, China and the UK.] Correct. They are the US, China and the UK. And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and, again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country. But, in the end, and this is the most important message of all, there are, there are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008 – where government had to intervene on a massive scale, then Covid – when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and, indeed, less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Who’s been to … hands up anybody who’s been to Peppa Pig World ? Not enough. I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig  World but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place – it had very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass-transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly, well a sort-of Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries, with theme parks both in America and in China, as well as in the New Forest. And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country – £6bn and counting. Now, I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? Peppa Pig? Johnson ‘losing the confidence’ of Tory party after rambling CBI speech Read more And no government in the world – no Whitehall civil servant in the world – could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you, as we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution and we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound, we are blessed, we are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London and all the … the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, we are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that, above all, is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you.” Topics Boris Johnson Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Conservatives news Reuse this content|1
43|North of England leaders fear region faces 'cheap and nasty' rail alternative|2021-02-18|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/18/north-of-england-leaders-fear-region-faces-cheap-and-nasty-rail-alternative|Leaders in the north of England fear that a new £39bn railway line could be scaled back, with the region ending up with a “cheap and nasty” alternative instead. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and others are concerned that the government wants to water down plans to build  Northern Powerhouse Rail  (NPR), which is supposed to halve journey times in the region. Currently, travelling coast to coast by train in the north can take longer than getting from Leeds to Paris by rail. Burnham told a meeting on Thursday that the people of the north of England “will not forgive us” if their leaders did not fight against the region being palmed off with a “cut-price railway in the north and a fully funded railway everywhere else”. £27bn roads plan in doubt after Shapps overrode official advice Read more Sometimes described as “Crossrail for the north” – a nod to  London’s vastly delayed, £18.7bn line  – a properly funded NPR would be “the single most important infrastructure project in the north-west in the 21st century and potentially the most significant rail intervention in our region since the  Rainhill trials , which led to the development of the world’s first passenger rail line between Liverpool and Manchester almost 200 years ago”, according to Steve Rotheram, the metro mayor of the Liverpool city region. Burnham said the leaders had a duty to ensure NPR was built in full, describing it as a decision that would “define the north of England for the rest of this century, and indeed, the one afterwards”. The business case for NPR was due to be signed off and published in March by  Transport  for the North (TfN), the statutory body set up to advise the government on the north’s transport needs. It would endorse a new line from Liverpool to Leeds via Warrington, Bradford and Manchester airport, and upgrades of lines to Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle. Leaders in the  Liverpool  city region are already concerned that government officials are trying to cut costs on their leg of NPR in what it calls the “minimum viable network”. In a letter sent to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Thursday, Rotheram and others accuse him of favouring a “cheap and nasty” old route previously used to ferry coal to a power station, instead of investing in a new line. Using that route would go “nowhere near the original NPR vision of 20 minutes [travel time] between both [Liverpool and Manchester] cities”, the letter argues. At a meeting of the TfN board on Thursday, the leaders were told the government had asked for all discussions of the “preferred way forward for NPR” to be held in private, excluding the public and media. Rival railway museums in row over steam locomotive ownership Read more Last week the government wrote to TfN to ask it to delay publishing its NPR “strategic outline business case” until it had published its own “integrated rail plan”. The leaders worry this will allow the government to dismiss the most ambitious elements of NPR by saying they are incompatible with its national plan. “Our voice is being marginalised just at the critical moment, and our ambitions are being downgraded at the same time,” Burnham said. He added: “I think we’re in danger of being sidelined at the worst possible moment … It feels as though the [transport] department is slowly turning down the volume on TfN’s voice and most possibly getting ready to pull the plug.” Rotheram said the move was typical of the “recent and ongoing neutering of many of the things that we would like to do”. However, the leaders reluctantly agreed at the meeting that they had a “statutory duty” to do what the government wanted and delay the publishing of its NPR business case.

44|Labour writes to CPS over 'fraudulent' Tory London mayoral leaflets|2021-01-25|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/25/labour-asks-cps-to-investigate-tory-london-mayor-candidate-over-leaflets|The Labour party’s lawyers have written to the director of public prosecutions alleging that Shaun Bailey, the Conservative party’s candidate for London mayor, used fraud to influence upcoming elections by  publishing leaflets headed with fake City Hall insignia . Bailey’s campaign last month drew cross-party condemnation for the leaflets, which said Londoners’ council taxes would rise “if you do not take action” and vote against the incumbent mayor, Sadiq Khan. The leaflets did not explicitly mention the Conservative party. Labour’s complaint called the leaflets a “fraudulent device” to gain undue influence, as described by the 1983 Representation of the People Act. Under the act, Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, is responsible for making inquiries into potential offences. The London mayoral election has been scheduled for May 2021, a year later than initially planned because of  the coronavirus pandemic . Khan is the strong favourite to win. Shaun Bailey’s campaign has faced repeated criticism for its tactics during the long build-up to the mayoral election. In November the campaign published leaflets and a website labelled as  “Transport for London bailout facts” , which contained attacks on Khan’s policies, before the “City Hall” leaflets. In both cases the campaign materials did not explicitly mention the Conservative party, only including the legally required reference to  Shaun Bailey  at the bottom, and the address of the Conservative party’s campaign headquarters. Labour’s lawyers, the London-based firm Edwards Duthie Shamash, wrote that the “City Hall” leaflets were “preventing the free exercise of the franchise of electors”. The letter, dated 21 January and seen by the Guardian, said Bailey’s leaflets were an “attempt to attract the reader’s attention with the pretence that it is issued from the headquarters of the London mayor and the Greater London Authority, such that it is an official communication from a public authority with powers of taxation”. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The Conservative party must immediately apologise for the actions of their London mayoral campaign and demonstrate that they are committed to following the law.” Labour has also written to the British Polling Council, the association of pollsters, calling for the Conservative party to publish evidence for a claim made in a separate email newsletter that “a majority of voters now believe Shaun Bailey will do a better job as mayor” than Khan. The newsletter said the claim was based on “our latest internal polling”, but most publicly available polling has shown  leads of 20 points or more  for Khan. Karen Buck, the Labour MP who chairs Khan’s re-election campaign, asked the council to try to identify the source of the polling. Members of the body have committed to publishing underlying polling data. Bailey’s campaign has struggled to cut through during the extended campaign. The  Conservatives  argue that Khan mismanaged Transport for London’s finances before it required a government bailout during the pandemic and blame him for delays to Crossrail. However, Bailey has faced criticism for comments made before he was a candidate that appeared to suggest that  poorer people could not be trusted with money , and for suggesting homeless people would have enough money to  save £5,000 for a house deposit . A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said: “We published our leaflet because Londoners have a right to know when their mayor is planning to hike council tax. The government have repeatedly said that Sadiq Khan does not have to raise council tax to fund TfL. So this is Sadiq Khan’s decision – and his alone.” The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it had received the letter but declined to comment further.

45|TfL commissioner told to consider job over Crossrail delays|2019-04-22|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/23/tfl-crossrail-commissioner-mike-brown-criticism-delays|"Transport for London’s commissioner should consider his position over his handling of the much-delayed Crossrail project, according to a damning City Hall report. The  London  assembly transport committee accuses Mike Brown of downplaying risks about the £17.6bn flagship infrastructure scheme in weekly updates to the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. An independent reviewer of the east-west railway through London reported “significant risks” nearly 12 months before last year’s planned opening but they were not properly acted on, the committee’s report also found. Crossrail’s leadership “fostered an overly optimistic culture, where risks were largely overlooked instead of escalated” and “the completion date overpowered any professional scepticism or critical assessment of risk”, it added. The report, entitled Derailed: Getting Crossrail back on track, calls for greater transparency and tighter controls on TfL, as well as singling out Brown for criticism. “Given the strong evidence presented in this report, we recommend that the Commissioner reflects on whether he is fit to fulfil his role in TfL,” it says. Brown , who was paid £375,000 in 2017/8, was appointed commissioner for TfL in September 2015. The  launch date of Crossrail , which has been beset by delays and budgetary problems, was supposed to be in December last year but could now be as  late as 2021 . Liberal Democrat London assembly member Caroline Pidgeon, who chairs the transport committee, said: “It is a complete tragedy that one of the most highly anticipated engineering projects the world has ever seen has found itself in a mess of overspending, mismanagement and an embarrassingly long delay. “Crossrail was supposed to be the beacon of modern, 21st-century engineering but its name is now tarnished with shame in the eyes of the London taxpayer who will have to foot the bill until its completion. “The inability of senior figures in the project to push past their obsession with a December 2018 launch date is one of the main reasons why their dream did not become a reality.” Pidgeon added: “It is shameful that nobody at a senior level is willing to take responsibility for the failure of the project thus far.”” Crossrail, which will be known as the  Elizabeth line  when it eventually opens, will link Heathrow and Reading in the west through new tunnels in central London to surface overground east of the capital to Shenfield and Abbey Wood. Last year,  Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild  was parachuted in to lead the project after delays were revealed in August. The project, funded by TfL and the Department for Transport, had a budget of £15.9bn prior to 2010, which was reduced as part of government cuts before again rising to £17.6bn with costs expected to go up again. The City Hall report found that Crossrail’s executive “did not have the skills required at the later stages of the programme to adequately assess and understand risk as the project moved from construction to operations”. The platform at Farringdon station on the Elizabeth line of the Crossrail project.  Photograph: © Crossrail Ltd It also states: “Evidence from emails between Crossrail Limited and TfL suggests that communications to the mayor were being managed by the TfL commissioner, Mike Brown. “Instead of communicating risks head on, these were downplayed in the weekly updates to the mayor.” Despite claiming Khan was kept in the dark by Brown’s alleged watering down of communications, the report does cast doubt on the mayor’s claim that he was not made aware of the Crossrail delay until two days before an announcement was made on 31 August last year. It came after Sir Terry Morgan, who resigned as chair of Crossrail in December last year, alleged  Khan had been told about the delay as early as July . The report says: “Crossrail documents strongly suggest that sponsors [TfL and Department for Transport] started collaborating on the communications strategy for the delay in mid August. This, in addition to the known financial challenges, makes it difficult to understand how the mayor claims he was not aware of the imminent risk of delay.” Khan said last night: “Both the TfL Commissioner and I have been fully transparent about what we knew about the delays to Crossrail, including around the key information that the previous Crossrail leadership gave to TfL and DfT. What is clear is that as joint sponsors, TfL and the Department for Transport should have been told much more, far sooner by the previous Crossrail leadership.” The report also points out that Jacobs Engineering Ltd, brought in to independently review the project, “reported significant risks to the December 2018 opening as early as January 2018” but TfL and DfT “did not sufficiently act upon these reports of risk”, instead accepting “Crossrail’s assurances that no threat existed to the planned opening of the central section”. If TfL couldn't make Crossrail run on time, what hope for the HS2 project? | Phillip Inman Read more A TfL spokesperson said: “It is clear that the responsibility for the delay to the Crossrail project lies with the former management of Crossrail Ltd. It is entirely incorrect to suggest the transport commissioner, or anyone at TfL, kept any information from the mayor. “The commissioner works to ensure that the mayor is kept informed of everything going on in transport in London and to ensure the information he receives is clear, consistent and accurate. “As the commissioner made clear to the Transport committee, it would not have been right to allow material to go to the mayor that was incorrect or inconsistent with information that the management of Crossrail Ltd themselves were presenting to TfL and the mayor in regular face to face meetings.” Major tube upgrades shelved as TfL struggles to balance books Read more A Mayor of London spokesman said: “Sadiq has every confidence in Mike Brown. Responsibility for the inadequate information provided about the Crossrail delay lies squarely with the former management of Crossrail Ltd.” Topics Crossrail Infrastructure Transport London news Reuse this content"|1
46|Crossrail could be delayed beyond 2021 target, admits chief|2019-04-26|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/26/crossrail-could-be-delayed-beyond-2021-target-admits-chief|The new 2021 target for the opening of  Crossrail  is liable to slip further due to continuing uncertainty about the software behind the new rail line, its chief executive has admitted. Crossrail on Thursday confirmed  reports last week  that services in central London would not start until as late as March 2021. A six-month window from autumn 2020 is the new target, the first public commitment since the December 2018 opening was abandoned. Crossrail said it was “a robust and realistic plan” to put the project back on track. But it warned that Bond Street, one of the main central stations, would not be ready to open by then. Hundreds of maintenance workers hired for Crossrail will be paid to “practise” until services start, it has emerged. Unions said the plan to start services in central  London  could mask further delays to the full running of the £17.6bn rail line, integrating the central and eastern sections. Twelve trains an hour will run across the central section when it opens, rather than the 24 trains an hour eventually planned. The Crossrail chief executive, Mark Wild, who was brought in to review the project when the original management team departed as problems emerged, said the date remained uncertain because engineers still did not know what they would find in testing. “This project is of immense engineering complexity,” Wild told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “The work we’ve done is working out the very careful sequence of knitting together all these very complex systems.” He said that while they were testing trains at full line speed in tunnels under London, and hoped to complete much of the infrastructure in the months ahead, intensive testing would be needed in 2020. “We don’t know what software bugs we’ll find in that phase and there’s no short cuts,” he said. He gave no assurance that it would definitely be open by 2021: “Our uncertainty is simply that when we get into proper train reliability growth next year, we don’t know what we’ll find.” Wild said that if there was a lesson for HS2, the high-speed rail network that will be Britain’s next transport infrastructure megaproject, it was that as a “digital installation” there were different risks from other engineering works. “When you get into software development and bringing that to fruition, there is obviously uncertainty and people should be honest about that,” he said. Wild also admitted that hundreds of staff were not doing the work they had been hired to do in anticipation of services starting. Speaking to LBC, Wild said that while 500 train drivers were “fully utilised” in testing and operating  Transport  for London rail services, “the drivers are not actually the significant issue. The issue we have is our maintenance technicians. There are about 200 highly trained maintenance technicians who are practising.” He said it was “frustrating for them and disappointing”. On Thursday, the TfL commissioner, Mike Brown, told the London assembly that  he would not quit , despite being urged to consider his position. A transport committee report found he had “watered down” the problems and risks of delay at Crossrail in communications with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Transport unions also doubted the new target dates. The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said it was more “jam tomorrow” from Crossrail: “Londoners who are footing the bill for this delay will not be fooled – there’s nothing concrete here about when full services will commence.” He called for a public inquiry into a “fiasco which has seen private contractors carry on making millions despite their failure to deliver”. Crossrail’s budget was blown last year, with two bailouts and contingency loans bringing the total bill to an expected £17.6bn, almost £3bn more than planned. The Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, will eventually link Heathrow and Reading in the west of the capital to Shenfield and Abbey Wood to the east, and carry 200 million passengers a year.

47|Hot Stew by Fiona Mozley review – a dazzling Dickensian tale|2021-03-10|https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/10/hot-stew-by-fiona-mozley-review-a-dazzling-dickensian-tale|S oho remains tempting territory for novelists, with its brothels, sex shops and seedy pubs still nestling among the private members’ clubs and sleek cocktail bars; it’s an inspired choice as the setting for Fiona Mozley’s second novel. The  Booker-shortlisted  Elmet  established her as a writer of wildness, at home in the most remote of rural settings, whose characters lived off the land. The switch to an urban location is decisive, but she’s brought her dispossessed cast along with her. The prostitutes and drug addicts and out-of-luck magicians who populate the Soho of  Hot Stew  are trying to get by, as the characters in  Elmet  were, without succumbing to the values of the rapacious capitalist world surrounding them. There is violence here, as there was there, but Mozley is interested in the idealism and adherence to principles possible at the margins. Together the novels ask us to envisage a society no longer defined by what happens at the centre, but where the types of solidarity modelled on the edges remake possibilities for everyone. Hot Stew  operates on a much larger scale than  Elmet , and Mozley navigates between the minds of about 20 characters with virtuosic ease. This is the Dickensian sprawl, made more fluid by the addition of a cinematic sensibility – it reminded me of the cinematic realism of the 1930s. There’s a dazzling panning shot at the start where she introduces us to almost all the major characters without pausing for breath. We meet the two prostitutes, Precious and Tabitha, who have a flat in a collectively run brothel, where they grow plants on the roof and sleep together in an ergonomic John Lewis bed. We meet the low-life magician known as Paul Daniels, and his drug addict sidekick Debbie McGee, and the inhabitants of their favourite pub. We meet, too, the young property developer, Agatha, who wants to knock down the brothel and pubs. If these sound like caricatures, then it’s because they are. Like Dickens or Balzac, Mozley is interested in breathing life into cliches, using two-dimensionality to gain breadth and social reach. Mozley has a background as a medievalist academic and her ease with typologies, with tavern life, and indeed with bawdy good-heartedness, may owe something to that period. Mozley’s achievement is to create room for nuance, even when the book’s world is drawn with such cartoonish vigour As in Dickens, the sociological typology is turned into something more strange and satisfying through the visionary dimension of the scene-setting. Mozley’s descriptions of locations are exuberant, whether focusing on the fabric-clad walls of the brothel (“the silk tendrils are the red of bull’s blood. They are the red of sow’s blood. They hang as if dripping”) or the labyrinthine tunnels of the Crossrail building site that provides the setting for a brilliantly theatrical set-piece scene. The so-called Debbie McGee wanders away from her down-and-out friends to travel through tunnels of concrete and mud, tripping over the roots of trees, drinking the dripping water, until she finds herself in a millionaire’s disused basement swimming pool (“a fevered Hollywood dream, a Kodachrome test-strip”). Filling her lungs with the “ersatz tropical air”, she embarks on a kind of lone rehab there. This could all have been too much, but it is grounded by the characters drawn from Mozley’s own generation: five recent Cambridge graduates. Bastian, the public school-educated son of Agatha’s lawyer, is oblivious to the poverty he unknowingly exploits. But a chance meeting with Glenda, a young woman he knew at Cambridge, introduces him to the precarious world faced by well-educated young people without family money. Glenda lives in a derelict room in Soho, getting by, unlikely to achieve her basic aspiration: to do a job she likes and live in a home she likes living in. Through Glenda, Bastian ends up questioning his own place in the world and his preparedness to perpetuate it. Bastian’s discovery of his own social conscience may not be enough to start the revolution Agatha fears (she keeps a boat called Versailles ready on the Thames in case she needs to escape). Hovering throughout the novel is the question of whether change is possible. Certainly, the forms of protest attempted by the prostitutes are disastrous, despite the media attention they acquire. Mozley’s achievement is to create room for ambivalence and nuance, even when the book’s world is drawn with such cartoonish vigour. Are the police right to want to crack down so vehemently on sex trafficking that they end up destroying the lives of prostitutes? Are the prostitutes right to mock the feminists who urge them to protect their bodies from men? Sex workers turn out to be a good vehicle for the book’s investigations, because their bodies remain determinedly individual despite their commodification, and because they are at once implicated in capitalism and remain outside it. Again, the connection with the Cambridge graduates adds complexity: Bastian’s girlfriend at university was funding her studies by working as an escort, a choice that he now comes to accept. In an age when so many novelists of Mozley’s generation take refuge in the dystopian, she has reinvigorated large-scale social realism for our times.

48|Crossrail delays caused by desire to cling to ‘unrealistic’ timeframe|2019-05-03|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/03/crossrail-delays-caused-by-desire-to-cling-to-unrealistic-timeframe|Crossrail  was driven over its budget and schedule because its management team clung to an unrealistic opening date, according to a National Audit Office report into the delayed transport project. The NAO said that although problems had emerged as early as 2015,  Crossrail  did not take opportunities to change approach nor produce a sufficiently detailed delivery plan to track its progress. Decisions were driven by a desire to meet the  December 2018 deadline  for the central section of the new west-east rail line underneath London to start carrying passengers. But that approach led to “choices that clearly damaged public value”, the NAO found. The report said that Crossrail’s “compressed schedule, contractual model, loss of downward pressure on costs, and absence of an achievable plan were set against an atmosphere where ‘can do’ became unrealistic.” Crossrail said last week that the core section might not open until March 2021. Changes to design and schedules increased costs on most of the project’s 36 main contracts, the report said. The costs of civil engineering works at Whitechapel station alone, as of December 2018, had escalated to £659m – six times the amount originally budgeted, and more than double the estimate in 2015. The overall budget for Crossrail has risen from £14.8bn to  to £17.6bn . Crossrail could be delayed beyond 2021 target, admits chief Read more The report found that Crossrail Ltd, operating with a high degree of autonomy from the scheme’s sponsors,  Transport  for London and the Department for Transport, “had a gap in its understanding of delivery risks and the likelihood of meeting the December 2018 opening date”. It said that “assumptions about the level of progress that was achievable bore little resemblance to the historic progress that contractors had made”. Management also drove unnecessary cost by carrying out early testing which was “of limited use and took any spare time and space from construction workers on site”. Crossrail has also now tried to rehire staff laid off last year in anticipation of the scheme opening. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: “Throughout delivery, and even as pressures mounted, Crossrail Ltd clung to the unrealistic view that it could complete the programme to the original timetable, which has had damaging consequences.” He said the full extent of losses could not yet be assessed but there had been “a number of choices made in the course of this project that have clearly damaged public value”. The chair of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, said the programme had been mired by spiralling costs and delays. She said: “It is concerning that Crossrail Ltd deluded itself for so long about its ability to meet its original opening date and the £17bn-plus programme’s project management was not up to the job.” Labour shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said it was “ yet another   disastrous failure  of  ministerial oversight  from the transport secretary”, Chris Grayling. Crossrail last month  set a new target  to introduce services on the central section of the Elizabeth line – the route’s official title – between October 2020 and March 2021. The NAO warned that Crossrail had not yet fully assessed the delay’s impact on costs. Mark Wild, the chief executive  of Crossrail, said it would review the NAO recommendations carefully. He said the new leadership team had “undertaken a detailed audit of the outstanding works and produced a robust and realistic plan to complete the Elizabeth line and bring the railway into passenger service at the earliest possible date”.

49|Tory London mayoral candidate criticised over TfL bailout 'facts' site|2020-11-05|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/05/tory-london-mayoral-candidate-criticised-over-tfl-bailout-facts-site|"The London mayoral candidate  Shaun Bailey  has been criticised after his team launched a “facts” website about the bailout for Transport for London that makes minimal references to its creation by the Conservative party. The website, titled  Transport for London Bailout Facts , describes itself as “everything you need to know about TfL’s second bailout”. It attacks the mayor Sadiq Khan’s oversight of the authority at a time when it has needed a  £1.8bn government bailout  after revenues fell during the pandemic. Only at the very bottom of the page does the site state that it is “published by Kerry Halfpenny on behalf of Shaun Bailey”, before listing the address of the Conservative campaign headquarters in  London . The website makes no explicit reference to the Conservative party or to Bailey’s hopes to challenge Khan for the mayoralty, meaning the website’s source may not be obvious to some readers. The “facts” claims have also been made in a leaflet campaign. The Conservatives have previously faced criticism for  masquerading as a factchecking service  during the 2019 general election. During the leaders’ debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s press account changed its name and branding to “factcheckUK”. Will Moy, the chief executive of Full Fact, an independent factchecking website, said the practice should be stopped, highlighting several instances of political parties and campaigners in the EU referendum creating similarly misleading materials. “It is inappropriate and misleading for a candidate for political office to brand campaign material as an independent resource,” he said. “In a democracy, voters need meaningful transparency to make informed decisions. Self-respecting politicians should make their own arguments in their own names.” The site first appeared on the Internet Archive, an automated web archive, on Sunday. Bailey does not appear to have shared the website on his Twitter account since then, but his profile contained a picture of the web address on a campaign vehicle and pictures of volunteers holding leaflets with similar designs. @WestHamCons   pic.twitter.com/5vwAjlAgcX — Shaun Bailey (@ShaunBaileyUK)  November 1, 2020 
 Bailey had been due to go up against Khan in mayoral elections in May this year but the vote was postponed to May 2021 owing to the coronavirus lockdown. The decline in travel since the start of the pandemic has pushed TfL’s finances to the brink, and the government stepped in to bail it out at the weekend. A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said Khan was “trying to avoid responsibility” for £9.6bn in money wasted by TfL. “Londoners have a right to know the truth,” he said. A spokeswoman for Khan said Bailey’s campaign was “deliberately lying” and described the website as “fake news masquerading as ‘facts’”. She said: “The Tories must stop trying to take Londoners for fools.” The government will step in with £1.8bn to keep TfL running for the next six months, after a heated political battle between Khan and Boris Johnson, his predecessor as mayor. In return, TfL has agreed to  shelve plans to build a second Crossrail link  and to investigate a possible rollout of driverless trains. Johnson and Bailey have argued that Khan was responsible for “bankrupting” TfL. Khan has described this as a  “blatant lie” .

50|"This indefensible military spending ignores the real threats to humanity | Letters"|2020-11-19|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/19/this-indefensible-military-spending-ignores-the-real-threats-to-humanity|Your editorial ( The Guardian view on Johnson’s green jobs plan: the right way to start , 18 November) says much of the government’s headline-grabbing pledge of £12bn for its “green industrial revolution” is spending that has already been announced. This is typical of the Tory political chicanery that the country has become accustomed to since 2010. But it beggars belief that at the same time – days before the spending review, when Rishi Sunak will almost certainly warn of impending austerity measures – the prime minister has agreed to a £16.5bn surge in “defence spending” ( Boris Johnson agrees £16bn rise in defence spending , 18 November). It is true that, as Boris Johnson says, the “defence of the realm must come first”, but by equating “defence” with increased military spending, he reveals the limitations of his political understanding. What is the point of increasing the defence capability of the UK against foreign adversaries when far greater threats exist from deadly viruses and global warming? Defending the people from illness and disease must also “come first”, as must defending children from food shortages, poverty and lack of education. A population’s security does not depend on military capability, but on a government’s willingness to spend money wisely to create healthy, happy and prosperous communities, to fund public services sufficiently, and provide decent jobs and living accommodation for all. Bernie Evans Liverpool  There is rightly a great deal of scepticism about the government’s green “revolution”. Before even factoring in the suspect accounting, double-counting, and inclusion of previous funds/schemes as new, etc, it’s worth comparing the figure of £12bn for this “revolution” with the £11bn spent in 2019-20 on roads; £8.1bn on Brexit planning; £18.7bn for Crossrail, which has still yet to carry any passengers; £88.7bn-plus for HS2; or £22bn for Hinkley C. Fourteen years after the Stern review, the notion that a fudged £12bn will foster a “green revolution” is laughable, and highlights how the climate breakdown is still not taken seriously. The response to Covid and historical examples such as the Apollo programme, the Marshall plan and the Manhattan project all show what is possible if the people and the government have the political will to declare war on climate breakdown. David Ansell London  Real defence spending ensures there is good food for all, addresses climate change, biodiversity loss and inequality, secures health for all against threats like pandemics, and invests in seeking peace by peaceful means. These are the existential threats to human security this century. To address them needs a radical rethink about the meaning of defence and security; current global levels of spending on military approaches to defence – almost $2tn in 2019 – cannot address these challenges. Failure to do so only makes conflicts more likely, not less. This is the time to progressively shift resources away from military approaches to national security in every country into activities that will truly defend people on this planet from these main threats, and to put much greater efforts into peacekeeping and peacemaking rather than gearing up for future conflicts, made all the more likely by the failure to use our resources to address these existential threats. Any claim to be climate leaders before Cop26 next year would recognise this challenge and see more investment in the underfunded “green industrial revolution” plan at a minimum.

51|London faces bleak future without £5bn cash boost, says Sadiq Khan|2020-09-28|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/28/london-faces-bleak-future-without-5bn-cash-boost-says-sadiq-khan|Sadiq Khan has warned that the capital faces a bleak future of crumbling infrastructure and a return to the “bad old days” of unreliable tube and bus services unless the government steps in with  almost £5bn of funding . The  London  mayor said that without further central government support, investment would stall and infrastructure would collapse, affecting the whole of the UK’s economic recovery. Khan said  Transport  for London had played “a vital role throughout the pandemic” but had been hit hard as a result of passengers following official advice and staying home. Uber granted London licence as court rules it 'no longer poses a risk' Read more Further borrowing was not a viable solution, he said. “The choice is stark: a safe and effective transport network that continues to deliver for Londoners and support jobs in the capital and across the UK, or a government-led spiral of disinvestment that sees vital infrastructure age and fail – wasting hundreds of millions of pounds, stalling economic recovery, and taking us back to the deteriorated transport network of the 80s and 90s.” He added: “I remember what it was like 20 years ago, before the sustained investment we’ve seen over the last two decades – crumbling tube lines, unreliable services, old-fashioned ticketing system and lack of coordination. We must not return to the bad old days.” Khan’s message came as Transport for London continued to negotiate a second rescue deal after coronavirus wiped out most of the fare revenue upon which it depends. A  £1.6bn bailout agreed in May  is due to expire on 17 October, and the prospects for London’s recovery have worsened with increasing Covid-19 infection rates and the government’s switch to again urging people to work from home. As part of the emergency funding agreement, the government ordered a financial review into TfL and demanded that its own appointees – including Khan’s arch-critic, the Boris Johnson adviser Andrew Gilligan – sit on the board. Khan has  contrasted the treatment of TfL , whose £700m annual grant funding was wound down after 2015, with the financial guarantees quickly given to private train and bus operators outside London. TfL is looking for £2bn for the second half of 2020-21 and forecasts that a further £2.9bn will be needed the following year. It said that without the funding it would have to reduce services, jeopardising social distancing on public transport, and cut vital upgrades, eventually running 50- to 70-year-old trains on some tube lines. It also needs more money to complete  the delayed Crossrail , or the Elizabeth line, a project jointly sponsored with the Department for Transport. A DfT spokesperson said: “The government is engaging with TfL and the mayor on the impacts of Covid-19 on TfL’s finances. These discussions are ongoing and will ensure London has a safe, reliable network while delivering a fair deal to taxpayers. “We would rather avoid negotiating through the media, so it would not be appropriate to disclose further details at this stage.” Topics TfL Sadiq Khan London Transport Mayoral elections Local government Local politics news Reuse this content|1
52|Wolfgang Tillmans on space, Brexit and Covid: ‘Let’s hope we get on a dancefloor soon’|2021-06-30|https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/30/wolfgang-tillmans-space-brexit-covid-hopen-a-dancefloor-soon|"W olfgang Tillmans  and I talk on the phone on 23 June, which he calls the “fifth anniversary horribilis”, referring to the Brexit vote. He’s at home in Berlin: a day later, he will travel to the UK to install his new exhibition,  Moon in Earthlight , in the seaside town of Hove. To conform to Covid protocols, he’ll be doing it on his own, without his usual assistants, carefully placing his photographic images around the space – a former Regency flat owned by his gallerist  Maureen Paley . These photographs range from an image of wet concrete pouring out of a nozzle to one of a root’s tendrils creeping along a gap in the pavement. They are presented in a variety of formats, from huge printouts suspended on bulldog clips to small photographs tacked to the wall. Like all his shows, Moon in Earthlight will serve as an installation in its own right, a manifestation of Tillmans’ tender scrutiny of the universe. It also includes a collection of astronomical yearbooks dating back to 1978, when the artist was a stargazing 10-year-old. “Mm!” he says. “It was the first passion in my life. I spent days and nights observing the sky or the sun and its sunspots. What it taught me was the importance of observation and that whatever you’re looking at is always a little bit at the limit of visibility. Like, is this a blur or a star?” One image, an amber blob on a computer screen, depicts exactly that. It’s the view from “a very large telescope in Chile. The fantastic pictures that we see by Nasa are processed, developed pictures that once looked like that screen. I asked the astronomer, ‘So what is this?’ And he said, ‘That’s a galaxy.’” ‘It was my first passion’ … Dead Pixels and Sensor Flaws, one of Tillmans’ space images.  Photograph: © Wolfgang Tillmans, courtesy Maureen Paley, London / Hove Tillmans’ work seems driven by an insatiable curiosity. He made his name in the 90s, photographing everything from Concorde to jeans drying on a radiator with a singular, searching perspective, winning the Turner prize in 2000 and going on to exhibit in the world’s heavyweight art institutions (his postponed show in New York’s  MoMA , To Look Without Fear, will now take place in September 2022). Some of his portraits have become familiar even to non-gallery-goers: for instance, the shot of a green-haired Frank Ocean in Tillmans’ shower, which became  the cover of Ocean’s 2016 album Blonde .  Sometimes Tillmans’ subject is just the reaction between light and photographic chemicals.  Saturated Light (Silver Works) , a collection of abstract images, was made by feeding photographic paper into a printer. Despite this plethora of modes (and he makes music, too, including a club banger,  Can’t Escape Into Space , released this Friday in a remix by DJ  Honey Dijon ) his work usually reveals something of Tillmans himself, from his political beliefs to his sexuality, and, above all, his sense of playfulness. One image in the new show is called Animalistique, and shows him crawling naked by the sea on New York’s gay holiday spot Fire Island. Nice tan, I say. “It’s just the camera exposure,” he replies with a smile. “I try to stay out of the sun normally.” Tillmans’ Resolute Rave.  Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans, courtesy Maureen Paley, London/Hove Given his urge to explore, and his obsession with the interconnectedness of things, was lockdown challenging? “In Berlin, there was never a lockdown [so strict] you couldn’t leave the house. So I spent a lot of time walking and observing the seasons. The transformation that happens between March and May is immense – I hadn’t experienced it in a solid block of time since I was at school. That was powerful and interesting. But as we got into the second and third waves, it all got a little less interesting.” It’s no surprise that Tillmans got bored: he is by nature a man about town. His pictures hang on the walls of  Berghain , Berlin’s famous techno club; he was a regular at  Adonis , the riotous monthly gay night in London; and I first met him in 2002, dancing to  electroclash  in a Soho sweatbox now flattened by Crossrail. Has he missed clubbing? “No, not at all,” he says, deadpan. “I prefer a cup of tea.” He laughs. “I feel out of practice in terms of moving among people without fear, the way you bump into each other and rub shoulders. Giving each other an elbow instead of a hand is funny and nice, but after 16 months it gets inscribed in our behaviour. I hope this won’t be the start of a pre-emptive inhibition in us. But I was reminding myself that in the  pandemic paintings by Bruegel , and other painters from the 1400s, showing village fetes, lots of people are very close together at a time when there was no penicillin. Humans just senselessly long to be together. We need to feel other bodies nearby. I hope the deprivation won’t last much longer. We don’t know what it has done to young people who can never relive being 16. Let’s hope we get on a dancefloor soon.” ‘I prefer a cup of tea’ … Wolfgang Tillmans.  Photograph: Sarah Bohn He calls Covid “the second viral pandemic of my life” – the first being  Aids , the illness that in 1997 claimed the life of his partner, painter  Jochen Klein , when Klein was just 30 and Tillmans 29. “With the very big difference of Covid not having any stigma and that, from day one, the entire economy and politics of the world put their efforts into curing it. This year is the 40th anniversary of Aids, and there is still no vaccine, which is due to the particular nature of HIV. But I think any anti-vaxxers [should remember that] all the people who died of HIV and Aids-related causes would have loved to take any vaccine possible.” Subersive ... pyramids, 2005 © Wolfgang Tillmans, courtesy Maureen Paley, London / Hove.  Photograph: © Wolfgang Tillmans, courtesy Maureen Paley, London / Hove Tillmans’ work often expresses the transience of things, whether it’s entire civilisations (there is a picture of the pyramids in the new show, positioned on its side to subvert “the supposed certainty they radiate”) or the fleeting joy of a nightclub snog. As well as his experience of Aids, he credits this sense of precariousness to being born in Germany in 1968, just 23 years after the end of the second world war – the same distance, he points out, that 1998 is from us now. “When you think how unthinkably horrible conditions and ideology were at the heart of Europe, it’s amazing that the civil rights revolution of the 60s could happen so soon afterwards and that things could change so dramatically for the better. But somehow it also made me realise things can go into reverse – that any advances that I enjoyed in my life can never be taken for granted and need to be defended.” It’s something he saw up close this month, having opened an exhibition in Budapest, Hungary, just a fortnight before  Viktor Orbán’s regime passed a law  banning representations of LGBTQ+ people on TV before children are in bed, or in materials used in schools. “In systems that are going autocratic,” says Tillmans, “the autocrats need to establish enemies within instead of focusing on the problems that society really has.” On a protest march in Budapest, he noticed some people were waving EU flags to signal their opposition to the anti-gay law. “It was touching to see that, despite all its shortcomings, the EU is seen as a hope, as an ally for a free society.” As a German who first came to the UK as an exchange student in 1983, and who later studied in Bournemouth and lived in London,  Tillmans campaigned hard against Brexit . “When you consider how grave the consequences are,” he says, “it’s striking how inactive people were. There was one demonstration a year after the vote, where there were a million on the streets, but that was just way too late.” He’s aghast with the Brexit we’ve ended up with – leaving the customs union and the common market, “so you can change some fantasy laws, the shape of your plugs, I don’t know. It’s a particularly British obsession, this idea of European cooperation as rule-taking.” ‘Britain is a unique creator of fictions’ … two of Tillmans’ anti-Brexit posters.  Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans/Between Bridges Did it show him a side of the British character he hadn’t seen before? “The depth of exceptionalism has surprised me,” he says. “Certain characteristics that all my life I saw as humorous or quirky are actually quite serious. I guess the colonial experience of being a rule-giver was deeply ingrained. To have your cake and eat it isn’t an experience that is considered normal elsewhere. There’s an amazing British quality in building ideas into a phenomenon, like in pop music. Britain is a unique creator of fictions and realities through that, but to see the whole country and identity be subject to a fiction was a bit sad. I believe the UK has benefited from contact with the continent, and so it is upsetting.” It’s also antithetical to Tillmans’ whole ethos – piecing together connections rather than ripping them apart. The overarching subject of the new show, he says, is “forms of human activity. The picture of the Queen’s golden jubilee from 2002 or a sexual health clinic education kit in a refugee camp in Kenya, and then the pyramids and then a sink with two weeds growing out of it. And pictures of nightlife interspersed. It’s a fascination with the shapes and forms that us humans create organising our lives, and then pictures of the larger setting that this is in – space.” No wonder he hated  Brexit . Set against Tillmans’ all-enveloping vision, it seems very small indeed.

53|Transport for London calls for second bailout to survive coronavirus fares slump|2020-07-24|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/24/transport-for-london-calls-for-second-bailout-to-survive-coronavirus-fares-slump|Transport for London is seeking its second taxpayer bailout this year after warning it would need almost £5bn to get through to 2022. The  London  transport authority said it would cut back investment in some planned projects but additional funding from the government would allow services to continue, as it struggled to cope with a coronavirus-related slump in fare revenue.  TfL will seek £1.9bn to take it from this October to April 2021, on top of a  £1.6bn bailout agreed with the government in May , with swingeing conditions attached. It expects to need a further £2.9bn from April 2021 for the following year. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and the mayor, Sadiq Khan,  launched   separate reviews  of TfL funding this week, with Downing Street and City Hall at loggerheads over how it should be run. According to  TfL  figures, the high proportion of its budget that relies on passenger fares – usually 72%, far more than in similar capital cities worldwide – made it uniquely susceptible to financial collapse when coronavirus struck. Andy Byford, London’s transport commissioner, said: “The pandemic revealed that the current funding model, with its unusually heavy reliance on fare revenue, simply doesn’t work when faced with such a shock. “Our revised budget looks to keep our services running safely, while we do what we can to continue the vital capital investment which will help London recover from the pandemic.” He said there would be “very difficult choices” about investment and some projects would have to be paused. But, he added: “We have a real chance, through our supply chain, to support jobs across the UK and help the country recover from the pandemic through a wide range of ‘shovel ready’ projects that support economic growth and build the green economy.” The additional near-£5bn in funds does not include the budget for the  latest overrun on Crossrail . The joint government-TfL scheme has stalled again, owing to coronavirus, and said that opening the central section of the Elizabeth Line would no longer be possible in summer 2021.

54|"Simon Rattle is leaving London. Is this a taste of the capital's future? | Charlotte Higgins"|2021-01-13|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/13/simon-rattle-leaving-london-taste-future-concert-hall|"I n 2002, the streets of Berlin were hung with banners reading, “Welcome, Sir Simon!” It was the year  Simon Rattle  took up his job as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic. This was big news in the UK, too: he was our lad, a proper scouser. As a young man he had made the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra glitter like something magical, and now he was going to take on the most celebrated orchestra in the world. It was like when Gareth Bale was swept off by Real Madrid. The Sun ran a rapturous editorial. Cut to 2015, and there was more big news: Rattle was coming home to be music director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). It was his “ last big job ”. There was an enormous sweetener, too: the prospect of a brand-new concert hall, a “centre for music” in the City of London, backed by the then chancellor, George Osborne, who’d seen the point of the project after “ speaking to the likes of Sir Simon Rattle ”. These were exciting, optimistic times. “This has all moved so fast, it’s like going down Niagara Falls in a barrel,” Rattle told reporters at the time. He would, it was said, be at the centre of an architectural project as culturally transformative as Tate Modern. That barrel got stuck. Although glamorous plans were  unveiled in 2019  , the new hall is looking more and more like a fantasy. And now it is losing Rattle, its champion: it’s a kick in the teeth for London, a negation of that proud homecoming. It was confirmed on Monday that when his initial contract in London runs out in 2022 he’ll stay on for only another year, rather than go on indefinitely, as expected. Instead, he’s taken a job at the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich. It turns out that running the LSO is not so much Rattle’s “last big job” as his second-last big job. Munich also lacks a great auditorium, though the Bavarian orchestra all-innocently noted in a statement this week that it “looks forward enormously to developing the artistic concept” for a new concert hall in the city, “together with Sir Simon”. Rattle will remain the LSO’s conductor emeritus, working with them for a month a year, a quarter of his current commitment. Rattle told LSO colleagues in a Zoom call on Monday that his decision is largely personal. He lives in Berlin, his wife is Czech, their young children are rooted in  Germany . In a way, he hardly arrived in London at all. The past year of enforced absence from the endless, exhausting global concert circuit has given him a taste for home; Munich is four hours from Berlin by train, a short commute by an international conductor’s standards and a pleasant ride compared with the plane to London. The well-funded German orchestra has a civilised work schedule, unlike the brutally hardworking London bands. His stated reasons are less interesting, though, than the wider backdrop. The concert hall feels like a pre-Brexit, pre-Covid project, one conceived when Osborne and David Cameron were entertaining fantasies about London’s future as an ever-expanding, ever-shinier global and European financial hub. But the plan always exemplified the capital’s dislocation from the rest of the UK. It looked decadent to an austerity-hit world beyond the M25, rather like the way that Crossrail looks enraging to anyone attempting to commute by train to more or less any other British city. Then there is the big European rupture. In 2017, Rattle told the Guardian that he would have been “ extraordinarily wary ” of taking the LSO job if he’d known Brexit was on the way. I don’t suppose the current row about visa-free travel for cultural workers – that is,  whose fault it is that there isn’t any  – is making him regret his decision.  He’s not alone among City workers of various kinds: 10,000 jobs have already slipped away from the Square Mile. Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be talking a good game about a bright post-Covid, post-Brexit future for London as a financial centre, but euro share-trading has  already tilted towards Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt . The future of the City and the new hall are, of course, inextricably linked. The project is supposed to  cost £288m , funded from private donations. Running costs are meant to be supported by the rental of office space within the building. Even if workers flood back to offices in the medium term, all this looks uncertain at best. Simon Rattle to leave London Symphony Orchestra in 2023 Read more The concert hall – its architect  Liz Diller  of Diller Scofidio and Renfro, who designed New York’s Shed and High Line – is also snarled in delays that have nothing to do with Covid or Brexit. It’s supposed to occupy the site of the Museum of London, in turn meant to move to Smithfield Market – which is occupied by traders with leases that don’t expire till 2028. Would losing the hall be terrible? I’m not sure.  The rhetoric that London, by sole virtue of being London, deserves a “world-class concert hall” never seemed convincing. If Birmingham, or Gateshead, or Manchester have better halls than the capital, that is surely a good thing. The visionary architect Cedric Price (after whom the bar in the Shed is named, incidentally) once told a client to consider the idea that building a house wasn’t necessarily the answer to his problems. Perhaps, he suggested, the client would be better off getting a divorce. “Build a new concert hall in London” feels like the wrong answer to pretty much any question at the moment. Perhaps Rattle has it right: a quieter and more modest existence, one that’s more sustainable and less frenetic, is what London needs – and what it will probably get, like it or not.

55|"HS2 was always a white elephant. To launch it now is a disgrace | Simon Jenkins"|2020-04-17|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/hs2-white-elephant-coronavirus-recession-conservatives|I t is beyond cynical. Almost every business in Britain is in lockdown. Shops are shut, factories padlocked, firms bankrupted, millions pushed into short- or long-term unemployment. They are told by the cabinet, “We are all in this together.” No we are not. Somewhere contractors are popping the champagne and consultants carting their fees to the bank. These are not medical suppliers, care home operators or testing centres. They are not the broken-backed small businesses to whose half-hearted aid the Treasury  still fails to come . The lucky ones are the backers of Boris Johnson’s beloved HS2. On Wednesday  notices to proceed  were posted in the industry press to Costain, Balfour Beatty, McAlpine and others. They should all get back to work, subject only to “social distancing”. Work at the closed Euston site should resume next week. The “minister for HS2”, Andrew Stephenson,  said  he wanted to offer those working on the project “certainty at a time when they need it”. If worried about lockdown, they shouldn’t be. The poor dears should resume their works. Rome might burn, but Nero did not want his Colosseum to run late. Construction on HS2 can begin, government says Read more Countless megaprojects – in housing, distribution, retail and construction generally – would dearly love such reassurance. This is not only because, alone in Europe, the British government refuses to give details of how it intends to end lockdown, so that businesses might at least plan. There is worry also over the wider impact of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s warning of an astonishing  35%  drop in the economy, certain to afflict all public spending, capital and current. Even the most insensitive politician could tell you that a new high-speed train from Birmingham to London, not due for over a decade, is hardly a priority. Every other service and project must pass through the valley of the shadow of death. Why on earth not  HS2 ? In such circumstances, some sense of priorities should surely prevail. Hence the frantic desire of HS2, its suppliers and lobbyists to maintain momentum and put their project beyond all further doubt.  In an effort to explain his decision, Stephenson grasped at the nearest cliche and declared he “cannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country”. But London to Birmingham covers the most prosperous counties in Britain. It is nothing to do with levelling anywhere, and certainly not the north. If he meant it, he should build an urgently needed railway from Yorkshire to Lancashire, or boost Manchester’s dire commuter services. Or if this is about vital infrastructure, why is Stephenson ignoring London’s Crossrail? It is surely more crucial for London’s recovery. Stephenson’s decision is nothing to do with levelling. It has to do with the  extraordinary power that lobbies  continue to exert over ministers, even in time of crisis. HS2 has been feasting on billions of government pounds, now possibly at risk.  There was a time when Johnson would have favoured Crossrail as London’s mayor. When he arrived at Downing Street, he clearly sought a new love. As his eye roamed the Treasury harem it lighted on a more voluptuous project, HS2. Poor Crossrail. Since Johnson’s February decision allowing the first stage of HS2 to proceed, it has become ever clearer that this railway is unlikely to go any further than Birmingham. It duplicates four other pathways to the north, all of which can offer any needed capacity by less exorbitant means. The chief beneficiaries from the extra capacity will be London commuters from the home counties and south Midlands. Even so, Wednesday’s announcement let slip that the project’s business case had plummeted from £2.70 for each pound spent to between £1.20 and 70p, well below any normal Treasury threshold. We can only assume chancellor Rishi Shunak has treated it like another aircraft carrier or power station, and shoved it in a drawer marked “vanity”. The coronavirus saga is speaking volumes on how British government operates, crisis or no crisis. Politics is dominant. It is now known that ministers were warned in  Exercise Cygnus  in 2016 that it was seriously ill-prepared for a pandemic. It did nothing. It did virtually nothing last January when Covid-19 broke out in China and began to spread. The only conceivable reason for this inertia is that antigen tests, ventilators and intensive care beds are politically boring. They can be left to underfunded locals to handle. Whitehall’s instinct is always to look to big solutions, with big institutions and big corporations to deliver them. Since the Covid-19 crisis began, I never until this week heard the word local at any press conference. It was all big NHS, big pharma and big science, never local health care suppliers, let alone care homes. A month of “protect the NHS” has given us grand – and reportedly half empty – Nightingale hospitals, while council-run care homes, responsible for the most vulnerable people, are frantic and under-resourced. The reason is simple.  Care homes are not central government’s responsibility , they are local and have seen disproportionate cuts under austerity. For the past month, they were not even included in the daily death toll – as if their deaths were unreal. Germany and Scandinavia, which respect local government, have been far better prepared and have benefited accordingly. It is plain that in Britain there has been a massive malfunction between the centre and locality, which any inquiry will have to address. Trains may not be that important just now. But the HS2 decision illustrates a common syndrome. It is a glamorous state project, favoured even as local rail services languish. To Johnson and his colleagues, small means nothing. The sum on the table for this week’s go-ahead for HS2 was £35bn. I am sure Keynes would approve of injecting large sums into a recession-hit economy. But on a single white elephant, I think not.

56|The Fifteen Billion Pound Railway review – digging into the Crossrail catastrophe|2019-02-20|https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/20/the-fifteen-billion-pound-railway-review-crossrail|T he second series of  The Fifteen Billion Pound Railway  (BBC2), originally shown in May 2017, was subtitled The Final Countdown. The third, which concluded last night, might plausibly have been called The Absolute Last You’ll Hear From Us on the Subject of Crossrail. But in the end they didn’t risk a subtitle, holding out the possibility that another series might be squeezed out before London’s much-delayed new underground service opens. The final episode was, understandably, inconclusive. In last week’s programme, engineers fitting out what is now called the Elizabeth line were still reckoning with a December 2018 opening date; this week the prospect of an autumn 2019 completion was already receding. And the £15bn railway has now become a £17bn railway. It was hard not to feel that the drama of the Crossrail project had long since shifted offstage The series has always been about massive feats of engineering undertaken with quiet insouciance, so the delays added a jarring note to the background hum of triumph. The narration (from an increasingly ominous Julian Barratt) spoke of “borrowed time” and referred to  Crossrail  as “the embattled flagship engineering project”, but all the people who appeared on screen remained calm and confident. Someone somewhere must have been pulling their hair out, but we didn’t see it. The first series focused on the drilling of giant tunnels; the second on the construction of vast stations. This one dealt with the final fiddly bits, the manoeuvring of large pieces of kit into small spaces without scraping the sides. A £65m escalator was divided into 13 sections in order to get it down into Tottenham Court Road station. Over at Paddington, with large steel beams being edged past very old walls, 28-year-old site manager Cynthia Mynhardt casually mentioned that the penalties for damaging a listed building included the possibility of prison. As ever, much of the pleasure to be derived from this documentary came from watching the work of people with jobs you’ve never heard of. One person was described as a “dynamic testing manager”, a title that sounds like its own performance review: you, sir, are a dynamic, if testing, manager. Most cable pullers, we learned, come from Hartlepool, and their profession involves threading many tons of fat, heavy cable – every metre weighs 18kg – through dark and forbidding spaces, the sort of thing people get up to in their most frustrating nightmares. Back at Paddington, banksman Eddy Bennan was hard at work doing something I had to look up. A banksman, it transpires, is someone who directs the operation of a crane from a position near where the loads are picked up and put down. In this case, Bennan was guiding the arrival of giant steel pillars on to their bolts, inch by sodding inch. “You carry on lifting like that,” he told his crane operator, “you and me are gonna fall in love.” That must be the most unsettling version of “well done” I’ve ever encountered. The Fifteen Billion Pound Railway review – like Top Gear for train fans Read more The programme ended where it began: with the powering up of the new Tottenham Court Road station for the first time. “Won’t be no bangs, hopefully,” said the electrician before the green button was pushed, flooding the station with enough juice to power 8,000 homes. I have nothing but admiration for people who can spend all day fitting enormous glass roof panels in high winds without crying, but it was hard not to feel that the drama of the Crossrail project had long since shifted offstage, perhaps to an office where blame was being apportioned, and somebody who deserved it was getting screamed at: ideally Chris Grayling, the transport secretary. There was no mention, for example, of the untimely liquidation of the construction firm Carillion, which had been contracted to do a lot of the work. The series remained steadfast in its determination to impress, and finding all the drama it needed in the possibility of an escalator not fitting, even though we knew it would in the end. I can’t imagine how little interest this sort of thing holds for someone who lives in, say, Wales. Ultimately we were left with the news that the revised completion date of autumn 2019 has been deemed “overambitious”, and the Elizabeth line may not open until 2020. So I think we can expect at least one more series – The Seventeen Billion Pound Railway: Painting and Snagging. By the time it airs, my train had better have arrived.

57|"HS2 is a calamity, but it would be politically toxic for Boris Johnson to scrap it | Christian Wolmar"|2020-01-21|https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/21/boris-johnson-hs2-scrap-invest-buses|D ecember’s election result was both good and bad news for HS2. Boris Johnson is  facing a dilemma  over the project, and his difficulties have been exacerbated by the fact that his victory was based on a surge in support for the Tories in the Labour heartlands of the Midlands and north. One of the first things Johnson did on taking office in July last year was to  commission a review  into the future of HS2, carried out by its former chairman Doug Oakervee. That was a way of kicking the issue into touch, ensuring no hard choices (which would have angered one side or the other) had to be made in the runup to the general election. It may have been a canny move at the time, but the election result has now made the issue even more complicated. The idea that a slightly faster rail line would solve the north’s structural weaknesses has always been a tenuous one The justification for HS2 has always been weak. The project was initiated a decade ago as a sop to environmentalists who were arguing against a third runway at Heathrow, and its supporters have consequently always struggled to provide a clear rationale for spending such a huge sum of money. Initially it was about cutting journey times, but then they decided it was about increasing capacity – despite the fact that there is plenty of space on trains running between London and the cities HS2 is meant to serve. Subsequently, attempts to sell it as a project that narrows the north-south divide have foundered on evidence from academics like Prof John Tomaney, at University College London, that it will do  precisely the opposite . The idea that a slightly faster rail line would solve the north’s structural weaknesses has always been a tenuous one – especially if nothing is done to improve existing services. The environmental arguments do not hold up either. Not only will there be widespread desecration in a swath of pristine countryside but HS2 Ltd itself admits that building the line will not reduce carbon emissions. Worst of all, spending is completely out of control, with the estimated cost of £55bn at 2015 prices set – according to a  leak of the Oakervee report  on Sunday – to be around double that at today’s prices. Contrast that with Crossrail, which has seen its cost rise from £15.4bn to £18.3bn, a mere 20% increase on a project which, albeit delayed, is almost complete. With Crossrail, however, even such a relatively modest rise in costs has caused a political furore and demands for heads to roll in Transport for London. The rapid rise in the cost of  HS2  has wrecked its business case. While originally there was the expectation that the line would generate £2 or even more for every £1 spent, the ratio now hovers around £1.30 for every £1, well below the threshold set by the Treasury. A chancellor with more experience and nous than Sajid Javid would be shouting from the rooftops about the project’s profligacy. Given all these arguments, many of them coming from the Tory backbenches, Johnson might have been tempted during his autumn honeymoon period to ditch the whole project in the expectation that the fuss would die down soon enough. Not now. Alienating all his new voters so quickly would be too risky politically. The good news for the project’s supporters is, therefore, that Johnson cannot simply ditch HS2 and cover his tracks with some piffle about supporting our friends in the north in different ways. Moreover, the new northern Tory MPs are quickly becoming a bloc within the party that cannot be ignored. HS2 costs could rise to £106bn or more, warns government review Read more Johnson’s difficulties are compounded by the fact that various compromises involving cutting costs but keeping the project going may well be counterproductive. Stopping the line at Birmingham would further weaken the business case, since it is only by going further north that its main proposed benefits are achieved. And at the London end, the big saving, estimated at £6bn, of stopping at Old Oak Common near Willesden rather than going into Euston would greatly reduce the number of passengers, who would have to take Crossrail to reach the line. I suspect that the internal discussions within Downing Street over HS2 are about whether cancellation, partial or total, can be threaded into a narrative that sounds positive for the Tories’ northern supporters. That will require a convincing story about how the “northern powerhouse” can be turned into a reality rather than a soundbite. The suburban railway systems in Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham are a disgrace compared with those of London, and that contrast will be exacerbated by next year’s addition of the splendour of Crossrail. The problem for Johnson is that improvements to those regional suburban rail systems will take time as well as money, and his best chance of winning some credit with those voters may well lie in rapid and extensive investment in buses. If that sounds rather unexciting, he should bear in mind that it may play better than promising a new railway that will not fully connect with the north until 2040.

58|Crossrail boss steps down after project delays|2018-11-02|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/02/crossrail-boss-steps-down-after-project-delays|Crossrail’s chief executive is to step down, it has been announced, a week after the government agreed to a new cash injection to complete the delayed £15.4bn project. Simon Wright will be replaced by Mark Wild, the managing director of London Underground, who will remain in charge until the opening of the central section of Crossrail, which will be  known as the Elizabeth line .  The line was due to be completed in December, but Crossrail announced in August that it would  take up to another year  to get trains running on the underground core section. Another £650m of funding was added in June, tarnishing the Crossrail construction team’s claims that the project is meeting its targets. What is happening with Crossrail? Read more Last week, a £350m loan was extended to Transport for London, the London mayor’s transport authority, to cover a revenue shortfall  caused by the delayed opening . TfL said full-time testing of the route would start soon. Mike Brown, the  TfL  commissioner, said Wild had extensive experience of major projects, which would be vital for completing Crossrail safely and reliably. Wild has been a non-executive director of the Crossrail board since taking over the underground. Questions have persisted about when TfL and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, knew the  Crossrail project would be delayed . The announcement came three-and-a-half months before the official opening was due, after admissions of problems with electrification and signalling systems. Khan has said he was told about the delay days before the public was informed in August. But a TfL board meeting last week appeared to reveal he was told in “June and July about the additional time that would be taken”. Caroline Pidgeon, the chairwoman of the  London  assembly transport committee, told ITV News: “I don’t think it’s believable that the mayor of London would not have been briefed that this project was behind time and overspent.” A spokesperson for the mayor said Khan had been told of increasing cost and scheduling pressures in July, but it was only as a result of an independent review commissioned by TfL, and the 29 August board meeting, that he was informed the schedule could not be met. The Elizabeth line should eventually increase the capacity for passengers to travel through central London by 10%. The line will link the West End with Heathrow and Canary Wharf, and serve suburbs and towns in the east and west. Once completed, the line is expected to be used by more than 200 million passengers a year. Topics Crossrail TfL Rail transport Sadiq Khan Transport London news Reuse this content|1
59|Inside the 'moving factory' that will cut HS2 through the Chilterns|2021-01-02|https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/02/hs2-chilterns-protesters|In a decade’s time, passengers on the new high-speed trains hurtling out of London will get just a burst of daylight and a glimpse of the Colne Valley landscape before disappearing back underground through the Chiltern Hills. Today, in that three-mile stretch between future tunnel openings to the north-west of the capital, the £98bn  HS2  project’s scale, engineering might and cost are all evident: both at the vast work site scooped out beside the M25 in Buckinghamshire, and in nearby waters and woods where protesters are still encamped to stop machines coming through. What was billed as the formal start of  construction of HS2 began  in September, after years of design, preparatory work and demolition. Funds were finally released for major works for phase one of HS2 between London and Birmingham after the government reviewed its decision one more time, with Boris  Johnson giving the go-ahead in February . HS2 map On Chalfont Lane, just inside the motorway, lies HS2’s biggest single work site, part of a £1.6bn contract to create just 15 miles of the proposed 330-mile network. An expanse of bare earth the size of 80 football pitches holds temporary offices and factories to treat excavated chalk and cast enormous concrete segments. The focal point resembles half an excavated stadium with two circular portals at one end: the start of a future 10-mile tunnel through the Chilterns. Two giant 170m-long tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are being assembled in this arena. Simply getting this state of the art German technology to the start line has proved an epic challenge. HS2 will not put a price on it, but each TBM will have cost many tens of millions of pounds. Transporting the machines from the Herrenknecht factory in southwest Germany by truck and ship meant slicing them into parts: the giant cutter heads, with a diameter of 10.3m, had to be bisected and welded again on site. The start of the tunnel through the Chilterns.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian Reassembly started last month and could take until spring, a giant Meccano set requiring a 600-tonne crane to complete. “It’s a moving factory,” says Didier Jacques, construction director, and a veteran of the Channel Tunnel project. Behind the cutter head will be a control cabin, where more than a dozen screens tell the operators exactly what is going on. “It is pressurised like a submarine so we can work safely underground.” The two machines, named Florence and Cecilia by HS2 Ltd, are a significant upgrade even on the beasts brought in to dig out London’s Crossrail tunnels: not just bigger but also capable of continuous boring to speed up the years of work, drilling onwards even as the 7.5-tonne concrete tunnel segments are sucked up and swung into place by hydraulic arms behind the cutter head. Further back is all the machinery that supports the process – as well as a canteen and toilets for the workers labouring within, and a refuge chamber promising 24 hours of survival should anything occur underground. Human safety will be improved by a pioneering robot, dubbed the Krokodyl because of its jaws, whose job will include removing the pieces of wood used to space out the hefty concrete segments. Segments are baked here not just for the tunnel walls but for a two-mile viaduct spanning the Colne Valley, leading south-east into London. While tunnelling takes much of the disruption out of sight and mind for the Chilterns, the viaduct will traverse the lakes and waterways of local nature reserves. Police climbers pull protester Dan Hooper, aka Swampy, out of a 30-feet high bamboo structure in the River Colne in Denham Country Park.  Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/Shutterstock And its construction will not just affect its eventual location, as the ongoing protests are highlighting. To reroute power lines in its path, pylons must be removed from Denham country park, a job that meant building another bridge and route through woodland. Work was briefly halted last month by more ingenious construction – this time on the part of protesters. A mesh nest in a 30ft tall bamboo tower erected in the River Colne was  occupied by veteran activist Swampy , before police moved in to end the standoff and allow the works bridge to be built. Now, more trees lie in the path of construction, including a number of oaks where treehouses have been installed by protesters. Sam Smithson, who left a job in fashion design to join Extinction Rebellion, has been part of the camp since May. Sooner or later, she says, the protesters will be evicted and trees felled: “It’s looking more inevitable each day but they haven’t moved in yet.” A cheerful Swampy, speaking before his arrest, said he hoped the protests would slow HS2 until the government decided to can the works: “I still think there is a very good chance they will cancel it: it’s unpopular already and more hearts and minds are changing now they see the devastation.” Despite the government’s go-ahead for HS2 last year, the network’s future appears to perennially remain in doubt. A report last month by the National Infrastructure Commission, previously a solid backer of HS2, suggested it would be better to  prioritise regional rail links  above building the north-eastern leg, which would link Birmingham to Sheffield and Leeds. Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary who launched HS2 as a scheme in 2009, points to facts on the ground. “It’s going to be largely built … there are 250 construction sites between London and Birmingham, there is £10bn spent, parliament has just enacted the leg to go on to Crewe… and it’s consulting on the fine detail of the route to Manchester. A line linking the three biggest cities in the country is a certainty.” However, the eastern leg’s fate will only be announced in the context of broader rail plans for the Midlands and north of England. Adonis believes the only question is whether it goes ahead now or in decades to come. “In terms of what the country’s going to look like in 30 to 40 years’ time, it’s one of the most critical decisions for 2021.” Failing to build high-speed links east of the Pennines  would, Adonis says, “be like the Victorians building railways to Birmingham, to Manchester, and leaving Sheffield and Leeds with the canals. In social terms, if it believes in levelling up, the government really needs to build the eastern leg. Or the east will be two centuries behind, and it will lead to an exodus of jobs and people.” With many around the PM remaining hostile, and the Treasury eager for cost savings, the political battle over the cost and economic benefits of the railway will continue. As will the physical standoff in Colne Valley. “We’re continuing building more treehouses and better infrastructure, so that they are weatherproof and people can stay as long as possible, with sleeping bags and tarps and stoves to keep going up there,” says Smithson. “The area is historically known for flooding, and we are expecting flooding in January and February. It will be a tricky environment for everyone, whichever way you look at it.” Topics HS2 Infrastructure Rail transport Transport Transport policy Rail industry Protest news Reuse this content|1

A fresh bailout announced on Monday by the mayor,  Sadiq Khan , and the Department for Transport (DfT), includes loans of up to £2.05bn to London. It means the final bill for Crossrail could reach £17.6bn, instead of the £14.8bn it was expected to cost as recently as June. A review of the project by the  new Crossrail chief executive , Mark Wild, has found that the planned opening in autumn 2019 –  postponed just over three months ago  from the original date of 9 December 2018 – is no longer viable. A new opening date has yet to be set. Crossrail boss steps down after project delays Read more Crucial parts of the infrastructure for the east-west rail line across the capital, including stations and tunnel interiors, have yet to be completed. The complex signalling system will also need extensive safety and reliability testing. Reviews by the accountancy firm KPMG of Crossrail’s financing and governance arrangements, commissioned by Khan and the Department for  Transport , found the delay to completion would be likely to cost between £1.6bn and £2bn. After the DfT and Transport for  London  jointly chipped in an extra £300m in July, the government department will loan the Greater London Authority £1.3bn and a further £750m to TfL for contingencies in the latest bailout. The GLA will also contribute an extra £100m cash. “It has been increasingly clear that the previous Crossrail Ltd leadership painted a far too optimistic picture of the project’s status,” Khan said. “I have ordered the release of all Crossrail board minutes in the last five years to provide transparency to Londoners on their decision-making, and working with the DfT, brought in a new leadership team. Sir Terry Morgan resigns as chairman of Crossrail and HS2 Read more “With London’s population continuing to grow, our priority must be getting this monumental project completed as soon as possible, with Londoners enjoying all the benefits the Elizabeth line will provide.” The documents show that Crossrail executives had flagged up that its opening date was at risk from July, but weekly official briefing notes to the mayor as late as 21 August continued to state that central London services would start on 9 December. Tony Meggs, the chief executive of the Infrastructure and Projects Authority, was due to be ratified as the new chair of Crossrail Ltd after Sir Terry Morgan  quit last week . TfL said that it was only just becoming clear how much work was left unfinished on the flagship infrastructure project, whose leaders had long boasted that it was being constructed on time and on budget. Wild said it was “evident that there is a huge amount still to do”. He said his team was “working to establish a robust and deliverable schedule” before confirming a credible opening date. The National Audit Office is planning to investigate Crossrail. Khan said the KPMG reports and minutes of board meetings would all be published in the interests of transparency. The Elizabeth line, as Crossrail  will be known , should eventually carry more than half a million passengers a day, linking Heathrow, the West End, Canary Wharf and beyond.

The National Audit Office is planning to investigate Crossrail. Khan said the KPMG reports and minutes of board meetings would all be published in the interests of transparency. The Elizabeth line, as Crossrail  will be known , should eventually carry more than half a million passengers a day, linking Heathrow, the West End, Canary Wharf and beyond.

They’re meant to be the future, the means by which artificial intelligence will rule us all. But it seems that they are not yet smart enough. With hindsight, it may have been a mistake to ask them to decide the future of a generation of schoolchildren. Or, as the government has also asked them to do, to determine the distribution of new housing across the country. Perhaps for now algorithms should stick to their core skills of flooding my browser with ads for earwax treatments or the news that People in Tower Hamlets Can’t Believe this New Funeral Plan, or that People born 1951–79 With No Life Insurance are in for a Surprise – and yours with whatever is appropriate to your age, gender, location and search history. For now, though, they have a new role, which is to take the blame when the government has run out of civil servants to fire, as Boris Johnson did when ascribing the exams fiasco to a “mutant algorithm”. This doesn’t seem very far-sighted, as it undermines the aura of unarguable and inevitable authority that is part of the usefulness of algorithms to corporations and governments. Still, maybe one day they’ll be clever enough to take a lingering and painful revenge on politicians who pass the buck to them, which will be a bright spot in our future existence as serfs of our digital overlords. One thing that algorithms could do already is to edit conservative newspapers. The programming is simple: choose a much-loved national treasure (the Proms, the National Trust, the British Library), then discover a “woke” idea to change it (it doesn’t have to be an actual decision, just a paragraph in a discussion document or an email from one employee to another), then manufacture outrage. Get your commentators to froth and churn until a blameless individual,  a Finnish conductor , for example, receives online threats to the lives of her family. As a bonus, if the blameless individual is sufficiently good looking, you can put a big picture of her on your front page and express sympathy for her plight.

Meanwhile, the Elizabeth line, formerly known as Crossrail, has announced  another year’s delay  to its opening, at the cost of another billion or so, which surely means that the next vast infrastructure project,  HS2 , will cost even more and take even longer than currently planned. Since these projects are predicated on ever-increasing travel to city centres, which may not now happen, it is not too late to divert the cost of HS2 to something more useful, such as affordable housing.

It refers to a celebrated case in the 1980s, when Oxford city council tried unsuccessfully to remove a shark sculpture fixed to the roof of a suburban house.

63|Sadiq Khan denies he was told earlier about Crossrail delays|2018-12-21|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/21/sadiq-khan-denies-he-was-told-earlier-about-crossrail-delays|Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said the former chair of Crossrail was “misremembering” whether he had been given warnings about delays to the London railway project. Speaking at the  London  assembly, Khan denied he was told in a meeting with Sir Terry Morgan on 26 July that the infrastructure project would be delayed. Khan told the assembly’s transport committee there was no “smoking gun”. “Either the previous chair [Morgan] is misremembering that meeting or for other reasons he’s decided not to remember what was told,” Khan said. Morgan, who resigned as chairman of Crossrail this month after nine years, said  Khan knew as early as late July  that it would not be ready on time. This is contrary to the mayor’s claim that he did not know of the delay until shortly before the postponement was announced on 31 August. Speaking to the Guardian following Khan’s appearance on Friday, Morgan said he was “not backing off one jot” from his earlier assertion that Khan was told of the delay on 26 July. He pointed to  a document from the 26 July meeting , published by the mayor’s office, in which a December opening was described as “not feasible”. The railway, running from east to west across London, was due to be opened in December but has been dogged by delays and cost overruns. The estimated final cost of Crossrail has risen sharply this year by £600m to £15.4bn,  forcing Transport for London (TfL) to borrow £350m . The railway, to be named the Elizabeth Line after the Queen, is not expected to open until autumn 2019. In sometimes-heated exchanges at the London assembly, Khan and Mike Brown, the commissioner for  Transport  for London, said Morgan had insisted in July the December deadline was achievable. Khan, a former Labour MP, also denied there had been “collusion” between members of his team to conceal their knowledge of the delays. However, Khan and Brown admitted they had concerns about delays and that they were not “fully reassured” following the meeting. TfL and the Department for Transport commissioned an external report into the project. Khan said: “It was only after these pieces of work were done that the former chairman [Morgan] changed his view on the opening.” The assembly’s transport committee chair, Caroline Pidgeon, said: “Someone between these two parties is not giving a full account and we will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this.” Topics Crossrail Sadiq Khan Rail transport Transport London Rail industry news Reuse this content|1
64|Where in Britain does China spend its money?|2020-07-11|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/11/where-in-britain-does-china-spend-its-money|Over the past decade, Chinese investment worth more than £50bn has flowed into Britain’s economy. From the telecoms networks to London’s famous black cabs,  football clubs  and Pizza Express, the Chinese yuan can be felt throughout Britain’s economy and its national infrastructure. The UK’s first stand against Chinese economic involvement may come within weeks as ministers move to curb the influence of tech giant Huawei on the rollout of 5G telecoms networks across the country. But a more difficult question remains: can Britain afford to close the door on one of its biggest investors? Tech and telecoms It would be very difficult to remove Huawei kit from the UK’s existing 4G network.  Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/Getty Images Lord (John) Browne, Huawei’s UK chairman and the former boss of BP, has warned that Britain risks damaging a “very long relationship” with China if  ministers choose to ban Huawei from Britain’s 5G network . Britain has a long relationship with the smartphone maker, too. It first began supplying technology to British telecoms networks in 2005, and it would be almost impossible to remove its existing tech infrastructure from the UK’s 4G networks without considerable expense and delay to the roll-out of 5G. Executives at BT and Vodafone have warned that removing Huawei’s existing 5G tech from the telecoms network could lead to mobile phone signal blackouts unless extra time is allowed. Industry Chinese steelmaker Jingye completed a £1.2bn deal to save British Steel earlier this year, saving 3,000 jobs. It is not China’s first multibillion-pound move into British industry. The Bank of China was among the lenders that  came to the rescue of carmaker Jaguar Land Rover with £560m of loans  after it struggled to get help from the British government. Aluminium Corporation of China, better known as Chinalco, also owns almost 15% of Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto, and the Chinese state’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation (CIC), snapped up a stake in Britain’s largest water supplier, Thames Water, as part of a consortium of investors and foreign funds.

It became one of the owners of Britain’s gas pipeline system after joining a consortium of investors that acquired the business from National Grid in 2016. It is one of many Chinese investors at the heart of the UK’s energy system. China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has for years been responsible for around a quarter of the UK North Sea’s oil production, including output from our biggest remaining oilfield. Meanwhile CGN, China’s state nuclear company, is eyeing Britain’s energy future. It has an almost one-third stake in plans to build the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation at Hinkley Point C, alongside EDF, and has agreed to take a 20% stake in the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. Eventually, CGN hopes to build its own nuclear plant at Bradwell, Essex, a prospect  that has caused alarm within Britain’s energy industry . Transport An electric black cab, built in Coventry by a Chinese-owned firm.  Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian The Chinese state fund’s influence extends to Britain’s main international transport hub at Heathrow, too, after it paid £450m to buy a 10% stake in airport in 2012. The black cabs queueing for fares at Heathrow’s pick-up points are built with Chinese investment too: Geely, an automotive company based in Hangzhou, owns the company that builds the LEVC hybrid black cabs in Coventry. Earlier this year reports emerged of China’s most audacious play for British transport yet:  an offer to build the HS2 railway more cheaply and in only five years . Though the offer is unlikely to be taken up, British commuters on South Western Railway and Crossrail will be customers of MTR, a Hong Kong company. Topics China analysis Reuse this content|1

The flagship construction project to create a new high-capacity train line across London had originally been due to be opened on Sunday by the Queen, but problems with complex new signalling systems delayed testing trains in the central core. Confirmation that the opening was  postponed by up to a year  was only announced at the end of August. Delays and departures as yet another infrastructure project goes off the rails Read more According to the Financial Times, ministers could announce a further £1bn bailout for the scheme as early as Monday. The  resignation of chair Sir Terry Morgan last week  – from both Crossrail and the next big British rail scheme, HS2 – has heightened speculation that further problems were yet to be disclosed. City Hall and the Department for Transport (DfT) have been in continued talks with Crossrail to assess the full extent of the shortfall and delay. Twice already this year, the government and Transport for London have injected further funding, of £600m and a  £350m loan , for a scheme long hailed as being delivered on time and within its £14.8bn budget. The DfT has been keen to shift any further costs on to London, after growing political pressure about comparative transport spend in the north and south – with the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, expected to pick the lowest cost option for one of the most eagerly awaited rail upgrades in the north, the overhaul of the Transpennine route. A DfT spokesperson said: “Constructive discussions between the government and  Transport  for London are ongoing on the terms of a longer-term funding and financing package for Crossrail, with London – as the primary beneficiary – bearing any additional costs via a financing arrangement. All parties are aiming to conclude these discussions as soon as possible.” Don’t moan about Crossrail. Once complete, it will be a rare triumph in our public realm | Will Hutton Read more Meanwhile, the delayed opening of Crossrail – to be known as the Elizabeth line when operational – will exacerbate budgetary pressures on London. The city’s mayor,  Sadiq Khan , confirmed a fare freeze for a third year last week, but revenues from Crossrail were expected to provide significant income next year. A spokesperson for TfL said: “Everyone involved in this project is fully focused on bringing the Elizabeth line into service for passengers as soon as possible. Work is continuing between the government, mayor and Transport for London on finalising a financing package to deliver this.” Tony Meggs, the chief executive of the Infrastructure and Projects Authority and a former BP executive, is being lined up as a possible chairman for Crossrail to replace Morgan, according to the Sunday Times.

66|Tories and Labour warned over ambitious spending promises|2019-11-07|https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/tories-and-labour-warned-over-ambitious-spending-promises-infrastructure-investment|Labour and the  Conservatives  have triggered a public spending bidding war, promising massive programmes of borrowing that will return public investment to levels last seen in the 1970s, according to Britain’s leading experts on the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said  plans  unveiled by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, and John McDonnell, his Labour shadow, would represent a decisive break with the past, but warned that a future government might have trouble delivering projects on the scale envisaged. On a day dominated by the ditching of austerity by both main parties, Javid’s plan to spend an extra £20bn a year on capital projects such as roads, railways, schools and hospitals was trumped by McDonnell’s proposal to increase infrastructure investment by £55bn for the next five years. The IFS said the shadow chancellor’s plans were the most ambitious. His party would more than double net capital spending to £100bn a year, catapulting the UK from near the bottom of the international public infrastructure league table to near the top. Under Labour, capital spending would be close to 5% of GDP – a level last seen at the time of the  IMF-imposed cuts in 1976 . McDonnell used a speech in Liverpool on Thursday to outline the economic priorities of the party, and said a  Labour  government would change the fiscal rules so that borrowing for investment would be excluded from borrowing targets. The shadow chancellor said his programme was “in the best tradition of British socialism” and followed in the footsteps of Hugh Dalton and Gordon Brown. He also promised to shift significant political decision-making power from London to the north. Asked afterwards whether the amount pledged could spook money markets and lead to interest rate rises, McDonnell said: “Our scale of investment matches the scale of those emergencies that we now face, on climate change and socially. I’ll tell you, if we didn’t set off on that march, future generations would never forgive us.” Javid condemned Labour’s plans as “fantasy economics” while unveiling his own plan, which would rip up the fiscal rules imposed by his Tory predecessors in the Treasury. Speaking at an aircraft hangar outside Manchester, the chancellor loosened constraints on borrowing to the tune of £20bn a year at the same time as attacking Labour for planning to “saddle the country with debt”. He drew a line under the era of George Osborne and Philip Hammond by setting a new cap on borrowing for investment at 3% of national income, while day-to-day current spending would be balanced. If the Conservatives win the election, that would allow borrowing to rise from £47bn in the current financial year to around £70bn, and then keep rising as the economy expanded in the future. Apart from a brief period during the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008-09, investment spending has not been at 3% of GDP since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. Repeatedly challenged over his decision to increase borrowing at the same time as criticising Labour for  wanting to do the same , Javid said now was a responsible time because interest rates were negative for the government and it was a moment for “new rules for a new economic era”. Ben Zaranko, a research economist at IFS, said: “Both parties’ plans would represent a sharp change in policy, and Labour’s plans are especially ambitious. The key challenge for a government seeking to deliver investment on this scale – particularly in a short timeframe – will be finding worthwhile and viable projects in which to invest. “Shortages in the number of suitably skilled construction workers, a dearth of ‘shovel-ready’ projects and practical issues relating to delivery will be challenges the next government will need to think carefully about how to overcome.” James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said:   “The economic plans set out by Labour and the Conservative parties today represent a dramatic shift from the narrow debt-driven debate that has dominated the past decade.” He added: “With the low cost of borrowing, austerity Britain is going to turn into hard-hat Britain whoever wins the next election. This shifts the focus to ensuring that investment delivers real returns, not just higher debt. “There remain big differences between the main parties’ economic plans, which will be fought over in the election. But the even bigger difference, following today’s speeches, is between the UK’s recent economic past and its plans for the future, as both parties have signalled a major shift towards a far bigger, investment-focused state.” Public spending on investment projects was cut sharply by Osborne after his arrival at the Treasury in 2010 as part of the coalition government’s attempt to reduce the UK’s budget deficit. It has averaged around 2% of GDP since. The spending announcements by Javid and McDonnell came as the UK’s  top civil servant blocked the publication  of a report by  the Treasury’s economic forecaster  that was expected to show that the public finances have deteriorated over the last eight months and that the chancellor was in breach of his old fiscal rules. Business groups, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the promise of more infrastructure spending, but struck a note of caution about the scale of Labour’s plans. “Our business communities will agree with  John McDonnell  on three fronts: the UK needs more public investment in infrastructure, more focus on upgrades in the regions, and more decisions taken locally, rather than in Westminster,” said Adam Marshall, its director. “We may agree on the aim – but businesses will raise real questions about how Mr McDonnell plans to get there.” Unison, the trade union, said Javid’s pledges of cash did not go far enough. Dave Prentis, the general secretary said: “After nine long years of spending cuts, this is nowhere near enough to repair the damage done to budgets, services and staff in hospitals, schools, police stations and town halls across the country.” Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said both the Tories and Labour were “writing promises on cheques that will bounce”.

67|Sir Terry Morgan resigns as chairman of Crossrail and HS2|2018-12-05|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/05/sir-terry-morgan-resigns-as-chairman-of-crossrail-and-hs2|Sir Terry Morgan, the chairman of Crossrail and HS2, who last week predicted he would be  sacked from both roles “within days”  due to delays and cost overruns, has resigned. The  Department for Transport said  Morgan, who became chairman of Crossrail in 2009 but had been in charge of HS2 for only four months, had stepped down from the senior posts. Morgan had become embroiled in a public row with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, over  Crossrail , an east-west railway through the capital that was due to open this year but is now delayed until 2019. The pair clashed after Morgan claimed Khan knew as early as late July that Crossrail would not be ready on time. The mayor insisted he did not know of the delay until shortly before the postponement was announced on 31 August. The estimated final cost of Crossrail has ballooned this year by £600m to £15.4bn,  forcing Transport for London (TfL) to borrow £350m . Whitehall sources said the increase, announced shortly after Morgan took over at  HS2 , was among factors that convinced the government he was the wrong man to lead the construction of the UK’s second high-speed rail line. Morgan said last week that he expected to be sacked within days, just four months after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said he would bring “world-class leadership” to the high-speed rail project. HS2 is slated to cost £55.7bn but has been  subject to criticism  and mounting concerns about cost overruns such as those that have dogged Crossrail. It is believed that Grayling and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, have since declared they have no confidence in Morgan’s chairmanship and urged the prime minister to remove him. Grayling said: “Sir Terry has been an integral part of  Crossrail  for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2 Ltd.” The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “While the boss of HS2 has resigned, passengers and taxpayers will be asking why the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has not accepted any responsibility and why he is still in post. “Once again the Tories are proving themselves incapable of providing the leadership to deliver infrastructure investment on time or on budget.” Morgan will be replaced at HS2 by Allan Cook, a chartered engineer, former chief executive of Cobham and former government adviser. “It is a privilege to be asked to take on this crucial role on the UK’s biggest infrastructure project,” Cook said. “HS2 will transform Britain through the creation of jobs and skills across UK industry. It will improve connectivity and passenger experience as well as creating value for the UK economy.” A successor at Crossrail, which is overseen by  Transport  for London, is yet to be found.

The Guardian has revealed that Crossrail employed the security company Control Risks to  keep tabs on union members  who were campaigning to reinstate a sacked colleague. Emails released to the electrician Frank Morris show that this monitoring involved weekly briefings on the efforts by the Blacklist Support Group and Unite the union to win Morris his job back. Both Control Risks and Crossrail have denied this was anything more than using publicly available information from social media accounts. Crossrail hired security firm to monitor trade unionists Read more Two former police officers who were employed by  Crossrail  are named in these emails. They worked in the security department of the publicly funded project. The emails show they oversaw Control Risks as it monitored the anti-blacklist campaigners. Control Risks was established in 1975 by David Walker, a former SAS officer, and Julian Radcliffe, then managing director of a political risk insurer. It is now a global operation employing thousands and has a history of recruiting former SAS and intelligence officers. There is no suggestion that the employees or Control Risks were engaged in any illegal activity or blacklisting either in their previous careers or currently. Yet time and again, when a company faces legitimate concerns about its activities, its reaction is to reach for the spies. A  HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report  as far back as 2012 warned of the risk of conflicts of interest if officers from units monitoring extremism transferred to the private sector and then attempted to make use of their old contacts. Meanwhile the Met’s former head of counter-terrorism, Richard Walton, popped up as the co-author of a report from the  Policy Exchange  thinktank into Extinction Rebellion, arguing that the protest group should be considered an extremist organisation looking to subvert democracy. “Those encountering Extinction Rebellion should be under no illusions about just how destabilising and extremist their agenda is,” the report declares. Walton  is a senior fellow at the rightwing  thinktank  and also runs  Counter Terrorism Global Ltd .  Walton retired from the Met  only days after it was found that he would have had a disciplinary case to answer for his role in spying on the Stephen Lawrence campaign. As well as the warning from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary over the private security sector, the  continuing inquiry  into undercover policing revealed more than 1,000 organisations have been spied upon since the 1960s. Despite the supposed checks and balances on the police, we have seen numerous covert policing scandals occur over decades. We should be concerned then about the adequacy of the barely-there safeguards and regulations in the private security industry. We should be under no illusions about the potential risks posed by former spooks passing unchecked into the private sector.

69|Balfour Beatty stalls share buyback amid coronavirus fallout|2020-03-11|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/balfour-beatty-share-buyback-coronavirus|Balfour Beatty , the construction company whose projects include Crossrail and HS2, has said returning some of its £500m cash pile to shareholders is out of the question until the full impact of coronavirus on its global business is known. Responding to reports that it had scrapped plans to announce a £200m-plus share buyback on Wednesday alongside its annual results, the chief executive, Leo Quinn, said it would “not be a smart move” when cash reserves may be needed to cover coronavirus costs. The company had £512m in cash on its balance sheet at the end of December. “We have said we would look at the capital structure after we are clear what the implications of Covid-19 are. Liquidity is the most important thing. Given the current market uncertainty, it wouldn’t be a smart move to give the money away at the moment,” he said. “We are maximising cash reserves in the event the virus becomes more impactful on the economy and the supply chain. We still have to pay wages to employees and to people on site.” The company, one of the main contractors on the  HS2 high-speed rail link , saidthe virus had hit its building operations and supply chain in Hong Kong, where it operates a joint venture. Quinn said about 10-15% of its 7,000 workers in Hong Kong had failed to turn up to work since the lunar new year holiday. “We don’t know whether it is because of the lockdown in Hong Kong or the coronavirus, but the two are connected,” he said. The company was also facing supply chain issues, he said, affecting products such as windows and curtain walls. Overall Hong Kong revenues would be down 10% in the first quarter. He said there had been no impact so far on Balfour’s UK business, although one staff member had self-isolated after their daughter visited Italy. However, the supply chain could be affected as some components came from China and were assembled in the UK. “What we don’t know and can’t get to is within any assembly there could be components from China that could be interrupted, but we don’t know at this time,” Quinn said. The outbreak is only a few weeks old in the UK, “so we don’t know the impact yet. All our sites and offices are operating.” Balfour Beatty’s share price gained 15% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as pre-tax profits for 2019 rose by 12% to £138m and revenues increased by 7.7% to £8.4bn.

70|Building crisis looms as dwindling supplies bring sites grinding to a halt|2021-05-15|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/15/building-crisis-looms-as-dwindling-supplies-bring-sites-grinding-to-a-halt|By tradition, the wits of every construction apprentice are tested with two errands early on in their career: to ask the foreman first for some tartan paint and then a long weight. The joke is ringing even more hollow than usual on building sites across the UK, where firms needing essential building supplies are facing some very, very long waits. The British building industry is in the midst of a supply crisis. From roof tiles to steel, timber to insulation, paint to kitchen sinks, products are scarce – and when they can be found, they’re expensive. Timber costs 80% more than it did in November, steel joists are more expensive because iron ore has gone up by more than 80%. Soft wood is up by almost 100%. Aluminium is up by about a quarter. Copper is up 40%. Plastics up 60%. Paints are up by about a third. A combination of Covid and Brexit has caused the crisis, while delays to global supplies caused by  March’s Suez crisis  have not helped either. They are affecting projects big and small, across the country. Garry Moore is one of those affected. He moved his 94-year-old father Stan into their family home in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex during the first lockdown last year, but space was an issue. “He didn’t want to go back to living on his own so we’re having an extension built,” Moore said. “A loft conversion above the garage. I thought it would be a fairly quick job.” Three months later, the roof still isn’t finished and several walls remain unplastered, but not for lack of trying. “My builder went up to the Midlands yesterday to look for some tiles, and he couldn’t get them there either. We ordered enough but we’ve only had about half delivered – we’re about 1,000 short. They’re normal terracotta tiles, but you just can’t get them. And there’s no plaster either. I’ve no idea when it will be finished.” Roof tiles are particularly scarce but go to most builders’ yards and you’ll hear the same story about virtually every product from steel and timber to insulation and kitchen stoves. “It seems to be almost everything that you need for doing domestic building or any sort of construction,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which measures construction industry pricing every month. “The only thing we’re not seeing shortages of is PPE.” “Demand has increased so rapidly,” said Noble Francis, professor of construction economics at University College London and economics director at the Construction Products Association (CPA), which represents UK firms that make building supplies. “Construction output in April 2020, at the nadir in the initial lockdown, was 45% lower than a year earlier. By March this year, it was already above pre-Covid levels.” Homeowners are driving the boom – spending is up by 19% in March compared with January 2020.  People in secure jobs with little opportunity to spend money on holidays and restaurants  decided to invest in their homes and gardens. That appetite for home improvement has boomed since the vaccination programme, after the collective savings of the UK’s luckier classes swelled by about £180bn. Garry Moore and his father Stan outside the unfinished extension.  Photograph: Andy Hall/the Observer It’s not simply higher prices and shortages – delays are growing too. Cold-rolled steel joists will take nearly five months to arrive, compared with the usual six weeks, according to figures compiled by Aecom, the infrastructure consultancy, for  Building  magazine. MDF wood, beloved of interior designers on TV makeover shows, usually takes a week to arrive; now it takes six. Roof battens were usually held in stock by building merchants but now there’s a month-long delay. And the reason why Garry Moore’s builder travelled 150 miles to look for some roof tiles is because the order time has gone from six weeks to a dizzying six months. “It’s not just construction output here that has recovered very quickly,” Francis said. “Global construction has as well. And that’s particularly the case in the US. Lumber prices in the US have gone up over 250% in the past year.” graphic Other factors are the blockage of the Suez canal by the Ever Given, and global shipping is still struggling with the disruption caused when Covid first hit and empty containers were stacked up in western ports instead of returning to China. The cost of sending a container from China to northern Europe jumped from US$1,475 in May last year to US$8,303 last Friday, according to the Freightos Baltic Index. Jonathan Hayter, the owner of Lloyd’s Gardens of London, has an order book that’s full to bulging for the next 18 months, but he has some more immediate headaches to deal with. “We have an account with our regular builders’ merchants and normally we buy pallets of 65 bags of cement,” he said. “These last two weeks, I’ve been rationed to five bags per collection. You can’t do anything with that. “I’ve had to tell all my customers: ‘You won’t hear from me for two weeks’. Because I’m just driving around builders’ merchants. I’ve turned into an Amazon delivery driver. I’ve driven about 600 miles this week going around Watford and north London, and by 6.30pm on Wednesday night I had a tonne and a half of materials in my van, driving really slowly over speed bumps. You phone ahead but no one will say if they have anything in stock – ‘Just come and check’. It’s ridiculous.” His cement prices have doubled, and stock quality is troubling him. “Some of it’s a shambles, absolutely shocking. We got some oak sleepers last week, from a reputable supplier. They were bent like bananas.” Anyone tempted to do it themselves is facing similar problems. The social media feeds for Homebase and B&Q have regular questions about the apparently lengthening lists of items that are out of stock, or will take months to deliver. Sheds at Homebase can be ordered but the firm’s website warns some will take up to 99 days to arrive. Most fence panelling at B&Q is listed as out of stock except its standard traditional fencing. Homebase refused to discuss its supply situation. B&Q said it was “working closely with our suppliers to manage stock levels and ensure we have products available for customers when they need them”. Some DIY-ers like Jake Shropshire, an estate agent in Hertfordshire, have pressed ahead. In January he began building an outdoor kitchen, hoping that the wood-burning oven and outdoor seating under a covered pavilion would be ready by summer. “Like the rest of the world during lockdown, we decided to do up our outdoor space,” he said. “I’ve got a friend who’s a carpenter and we’ve been doing it together. I thought it would take a few weekends.” Four oak posts that were meant to arrive in 10 days still hadn’t turned up eight weeks later. The timber for the roof and sides has turned up piecemeal, if at all, and it was a battle to get the concrete base done. “I just got an email today about the kitchen units, saying the container from China has been delayed,” Shropshire said. “It should have been here in March and now they’re saying it’s going to be July.” The reality of buyers competing for the attention of sellers is that wholesalers and builders’ merchants will tend to favour regular, larger customers, Brock said. Large infrastructure projects such as HS2, the London tideway, Crossrail, the Leeds flood alleviation scheme and Birmingham’s Big City plan are unlikely to be affected. “The builders’ merchants and distributors will be selecting who they supply to based on long-term loyalty and long-term plans,” he said. “The construction sector is typically not very good at long-term planning, which means they’re not good at forecasting what they need, and so suppliers don’t know how much they need to order. “Most builders don’t have any idea where most of their supplies come from, and they haven’t had to care until the last 12 months.” So where do the UK’s supplies come from? Bricks and bulky materials like sand and gravel are almost all locally produced – 76% of materials are made in the UK – but about two-thirds of sawn wood is imported, according to the Forestry Commission. Much of it comes from Europe, particularly Sweden, but the US is now competing for wood. The number of construction workers has fallen by 42% since 2017, with London being particularly hard hit.  Photograph: Malcolm Park/Alamy Europe’s larger manufacturing base also provides a substantial proportion of UK steel and other metals. Plastics rely on the oil industry, and February’s big freeze in Texas caused polymer production to crash by 80%. Specialist products need to be sourced from further afield. When Garry Moore is not worrying about his dad’s roof, he makes a living as an inventor – the originator of the Propelair toilet, which uses 84% less water than a standard loo by flushing with compressed air, but is only fitted in offices and commercial buildings. Moore has created a smaller toilet, the Velocity, which is suitable for domestic houses – “it could save an enormous amount of water”, he said – and is about to launch trials of his new invention with Essex County Council. “It uses plastics and ceramics,” he said. “But we’ve had trouble sourcing ceramic suppliers, and also the polymers for the plastic parts. So I’m arranging the trip to China next month to go to the factories, and try and sort suppliers.” Rather like during last year’s rush for PPE, securing supplies can rest on personal relationships with factory bosses. There is little else that firms can do but wait, and plan ahead. The UK is a modest buyer in global terms compared to the US, China and the Middle East, Brock said. Brexit is another factor. Some smaller EU exporters have given up on the UK because of new trade barriers, according to  Building  magazine. Peter Caplehorn, the CPA’s chief executive, said last week that the UK could run out of key materials because there are not enough facilities to test them and provide the new UKCA certification which replaces the European CE quality mark. Even those builders in the southeast who have materials are finding it impossible to recruit skilled workers because the number of construction workers from the EU in the UK has fallen by 42% since 2017, from 208,067 to 120,723 – nearly all having worked in London. “Don’t even go there,” Hayter said. “There’s not a shortage – there’s just no labour. The cupboard’s bare.” Yorkshire and the north-west, which have been riding the wave of the UK’s building boom, may see workers heading south for higher wages. “If they build a third runway at Heathrow, it will suck up all the spare subcontractor labour,” Brock said. “People vote with their feet. That’s why you get the vans on the motorway on a Monday driving down from the north-east.” Mark Beard, the chairman of Beard construction, said there may be a second squeeze on labour in the south, if eastern European subcontractors decide to take longer holidays to make up for time missed during the lockdowns. “We’re nervous about the summer,” he said. “If Europe opens up, some of our eastern European labour might want to take four or five weeks off this summer, instead of the two weeks they’ve had in the past.” The rising prices may hurt firms which had longer contracts, because they were locked into lower pre-pandemic prices, he added, and the industry is also facing higher insurance costs after the Grenfell disaster. “But there is a flip side – it really forces people to look at their procedures, to minimise risk. It’s driving better behaviours, better processes.” And if wages rise, that might push building firms towards  modular manufacturing  – building homes in factories.  “The car industry went through a crisis in the 1970s and came out renewed. If we get a perfect storm in our industry, people will look for innovations that will make us better five years down the road.” Topics Construction industry The Observer Brexit news Reuse this content|1
71|Kier shares plunge more than 40% after profit warning|2019-06-03|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/03/kier-constrution-firm-shares-tumble-after-profit-warning|Investors dumped shares in  Kier  Group on Monday after a profit warning from the construction and services company prompted comparisons with Carillion, its former rival that collapsed last year. Kier, which employs 20,000 people and works on large infrastructure projects such as HS2 and London’s  delayed Crossrail  , said its underlying full-year profits would be substantially below earlier forecasts, at about £129m rather than £169m. Shares in the FTSE 250 company plummeted by 41% to 163.8p, their lowest level since February 1999. Quick Guide The lowdown on Kier Group Show Kier builds and maintains infrastructure and buildings for the public and private sector, such as roads, rail, schools, hospitals, student housing, prisons, offices and homes. It took on Carillion’s share in HS2, the high-speed rail project that will connect London with other major cities.

Thank you for your feedback. This is less than half the 409p a share investors paid in December, when Kier launched a £264m emergency fundraising in an attempt to avoid the same fate as  Carillion, the construction and services company that collapsed into insolvency  in January 2018. John Moore, a senior investment manager at investment firm Brewin Dolphin, said: “Kier is in a dark place. At the turn of the year the business set out its financials, trading performance and future plans as part of its unsuccessful rights issue, only to now say that this information was largely wrong. It has broken trust with investors, which does not bode well. “Comparisons will be made with the likes of Carillion and, indeed, Kier has lots of complex long-term contracts and individual subsidiaries, which makes for an opaque situation where clarity and stability are desired. Where it goes from here is hard to say.” Kier  investors shunned December’s cash call , with only 38% of the shares taken up, and financial institutions had to step in. Its chief executive Haydn Mursell quit the following month after eight years in the job. Hedge funds betting against the company have started to circle, with at least 4.8% of shares – equivalent to £21.4m before Monday’s share price fall – on loan to short sellers, who profit when the share price falls. London-based fund managers Marshall Wace and Kuvari Partners were the biggest winners, with shorts of about 1.5% each. The slump dealt another blow to star investment manager  Neil Woodford, who suspended shares  in his LF Woodford Equity Income Fund after markets closed on Monday. His funds, which own more than 20% of shares in Kier, lost £37m during the day. Woodford bought shares in Kier as recently as 16 May, according to market disclosures. Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the stockbroker the Share Centre, said: “The shares are now down 85% over the past year and there are clearly fears in the market that the company could be heading for the same fate as Carillion.” Kier, which took on Carillion’s share of the  HS2  high-speed rail project and took sole ownership of Highways England’s smart motorway programme in Cheshire, is also the UK’s leading regional builder of schools and hospitals. It said revenue growth at its regional buildings business would be lower than forecast. In March, Kier reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £35.5m and flagged up problems in its highways, utilities and housing maintenance divisions. It has been hit by Highways England cutting back on maintenance spending and delays in telecoms companies’ fibre rollout. As a result, the company said underlying operating profit for the year to 30 June would be £25m lower than City forecasts of £169m, with revenues unchanged from last year at £4.5bn. In addition, Kier is taking a £15m hit from higher restructuring costs this year. The company’s chief executive, Andrew Davies, who joined from construction group Wates in March and had been lined up to take over at Carillion before the latter collapsed, is ramping up a programme to streamline Kier. The group also warned on its debt. Analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt had expected Kier to have £15m of net cash at the end of its year in June but now forecasts net debt of £60m. That is still down from £186m in June 2018, which partly reflects proceeds from December’s fundraising. The group will announce the outcome of a strategic review on 30 July and is reportedly in talks to sell its housing maintenance arm.

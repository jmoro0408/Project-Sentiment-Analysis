Energy firm EDF, which runs the site, said Bylor was in discussions with workers about resolving the issues. It is understood that the vast majority of the site's 7,500 staff have not taken part in the walkout. A spokesperson for Bylor said: ""Whilst other members of our Bylor team continued to work as normal at Hinkley Point C today, some have chosen to stand down. ""This group of workers have expressed concerns about their working arrangements at Hinkley Point C."" EDF said discussions, involving Bylor and unions, were taking place to try and resolve the issues. The Bylor spokesperson said the talks with staff were aimed at resolving ""their concerns so that we can achieve a resolution and return to work"".

Ten crews were sent to tackle it and the fire was extinguished in about 30 minutes. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue service said there were no reported injuries. EDF Energy said construction work had not been affected and an investigation into the cause was under way. A company spokesman said it was a ""small fire in a temporary building away from the main construction area"".  Hinkley Point C is being built at a cost of between £22bn to £23bn and is expected to open in 2026.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-58629736,2021-09-20
2,Hinkley Point C nuclear plant to open later at greater cost,"French energy firm EDF said it had made ""significant progress"" at the Bridgwater site despite the impact of coronavirus and lockdown restrictions. The plant is due to open in June 2026 and not in 2025 as planned and will cost between £22bn and £23bn. It is expected to generate electricity for up to six million homes. That equates to about 7% of the UK's energy supply.  Original estimates for the cost of the power station had been £18bn in 2016 but they have been repeatedly revised up.  Previous costings  , and £20.3bn before that.  The first reactor's base was completed in June 2019 and the second reactor base was completed on time last summer.  The number of workers at the site has been reduced to enable social distancing during the pandemic. Where that is not possible, workers have used additional protective equipment.  Plans for Hinkley Point C were announced more than a decade ago and they gained government approval in 2016.

3,"Hinkley Point C nuclear plant 'on track', says EDF","The construction of Hinkley Point C began two years ago after the government signed a deal with French firm EDF and its Chinese partner CGN. It is expected to provide 7% of the UK's electricity needs for 60 years. EDF said it would be a ""significant moment"" when a 4,500 tonne concrete platform supporting the reactor buildings was completed in 2019. More than 3,200 people are building the power station near Bridgwater. Stuart Crooks, Hinkley Point C managing director, said unions, contractors and suppliers had all been ""successfully working together"" on the plant, which is expected to open in 2025. ""Everyone working on the project should be proud of what they have achieved so far,"" he said. ""I am also proud of the positive impact that Hinkley Point C is having on the south west."" Peter McIntosh, from Unite union, said the plant was continuing to be an ""enormous jobs generator"" for the south-west of England. ""It is creating thousands of highly skilled construction jobs and EDF has already started to deliver on its commitments with over 250 apprenticeships,"" he said.

4,"Hinkley Point C: 1,000 Welsh workers at English nuclear plant","It comes after several large infrastructure projects in Wales were either cancelled or suspended. These include  ,  ,   and the  .  Hinkley Point C also took on 21 apprentices from Wylfa Newydd. One of them is 21-year-old Jessica Williams, who is in the second year of her apprenticeship and will move about 280 miles south to Somerset this summer to complete her qualification.  When Wylfa Newydd, on Anglesey, was suspended earlier this year, the French company behind Hinkley Point C, EDF, came looking for future workers. ""The transition was a bit of a shock to be honest… I would have liked to stay on Anglesey but it's a good opportunity so I can't give it a miss,"" Miss Williams said. ""It's a bit disheartening to be honest, but you've got to do what you've got to do."" She said she was excited to see where her career and transferable skills take her, but hoped to return to Anglesey at some point.  EDF has also looked to Wales for construction workers to build Hinkley Point C. Most of the 1,000 Welsh construction workers travel there at the beginning of a week and stay in the specially-constructed ""Hinkley campus"", before returning home on a Friday. At one point there was concern there would be a construction skills shortage in Wales because of the number of large infrastructure projects in the pipeline, but they did not get off the ground. Robert Morris from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, is a carpenter with 30 years' experience. He started the job in Somerset in February after working on a hospital in Cwmbran.  ""In this game if you've got a year's work, you're laughing. I've got a lot more than that... It's nice to have certainty, especially in the construction industry."" Anecdotally, it is well-paid work and EDF said the project had already spent £1.1bn in the region - there are also about 80 Welsh companies in the supply chain. CBI Wales director Ian Price said it was great to see Welsh firms winning business across the UK.  ""However, the fact that many Welsh firms have to travel so far to find work is a reflection on the scarcity of made-in-Wales infrastructure projects,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-48760581,2019-06-25

They said the tower, which was being used to make concrete, did not collapse and nobody was injured. The emergency services were not required and an investigation into the cause is underway. A large dust cloud was caused because the silo contained finely ground particles of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), which are added to the concrete mix, the spokesperson said. The BBC understands the weight of the particles caused the bottom to fall out of the silo.

A spokeswoman for EDF Energy said the state aid investigation had been ""exhaustive, fair and robust"". But Austria's ministry for sustainability and tourism said it regretted the judgement which sends a wrong signal about subsidies for building nuclear power plants.  ""The reasons for rejecting the lawsuit against Hinkley Point C will now be carefully examined, and the Austrian government will then decide on a timely appeal,"" it said.  The construction of the Hinkley Point C power station, near Bridgwater, is likely to cost £19.6bn and it is due to be up-and-running by the end of 2025.

EDF Energy's delivery director for Hinkley C, Nigel Cann, said: ""We've been really able to learn lessons and be much more efficient the second time round."" The site should be completed by 2025.  ""When we did the first one, it was the first one built in a generation so the second one came to us a bit more easily, so it shows you experience is everything,"" Mr Cann said. The base was made from 20,000 m3 of nuclear grade concrete which was poured in using boom cranes. The concrete base for the first reactor was completed in June 2019. The next milestone is to build the roof of the first reactor. ""This is the iconic cylindrical building that will eventually hold the reactor and we are looking to do that as soon as possible in 2022,"" Mr Cann said. Since the lockdown began on 23 March, EDF Energy reduced the number workers from 4,000 to about 2,000 to ""enforce better social distancing"" on site.

11,Hinkley Point C: Life inside a nuclear power station construction campus,"Many are staying in two campuses built to help cope with this influx of workers on the Hinkley Point C plant.  Somerset firms were chosen to run the campuses and to provide food and drink, in an bid to help the local economy. While there were  , mainly men, coming into the area, police say they have dealt with just a few minor complaints. One worker said staying at the campus meant he could meet people from different walks of life ""so socially that's a good thing"". The two campus sites, at Bridgwater and Cannington, are both a few miles from the construction site. Front of house worker, Kady Finka, lives in Bridgwater and used to work in a pre-school. She said: ""It sounds like a cliché but I really love my job here, the people are amazing. ""People have come to me and asked, 'Aren't you going to be nervous working on that campus with all those men?' ""No, why would you be?"" The construction project has a drug and alcohol policy that involves random testing, not being allowed to report for work if under the influence of drugs or alcohol and not consuming any on site at Hinkley Point C. If anyone is believed to be under the influence they can also be tested and reported. Also anyone caught using illegal drugs will be reported to the police. Ms Finka said she did not think people working there would run the risk of causing trouble in the local area and the strict rules helped ensure that. Lee Bottomley from Yeovil works for Wincanton Logistics. He oversees the paperwork of all the assets going on to the site - which currently stands at about six million items to have gone into Hinkley Point C since he started working there in 2010. He regularly stays at one of the campuses and said: ""I don't think it's like a university campus, it's superior to that. ""You speak to various people doing the tunnelling, the jetties, to do the marine works - so you get to talk to people from different walks of life that you generally wouldn't get to talk to on the project. ""So, socially that's a good thing - there's people from Poland, France, even local people from Bridgwater who come to stay here."" From the very start of the project, EDF Energy said it wanted to use Somerset suppliers and employ as many local residents as possible. One example is a local company, Host Somerset which runs the two workers' campuses. The larger, Bridgwater-based Sedgemoor campus opened in October and can house 986 people. General manager, Paul Warburton said: ""We've got 340 staff between both of the campuses and as they get busier the staff bases will move.  ""This week we've got 120 working out of Sedgemoor and many of them are from the local community and can actually walk to work. ""So 24% of all of the team are based within a mile of here in Sydenham, over 70% are based within 20 miles and very few are based outside of that area."" Caterers Somerset Larder are local and food is sourced in the area where possible. The ales available are also made in the county. EDF Energy's external communications manager, Andrew Cockcroft, said: ""The Somerset Larder and Quantock Brewery - they're prime examples of how we're keeping things as local as we can. ""On the supply chain we could have quite easily gone to big national suppliers, a big accommodation facilities management company to run the campus, a big framework contract to run the place, a national caterer to put the restaurant in place, all of that. ""But we chose the difficult route, which is helping local companies run the place and work in it as well."" Caroline Norris from Taunton oversees the contract between Host and EDF Energy.  She used to be an officer in the Intelligence Corps for nine years, working in Afghanistan, Qatar and weapons intelligence. ""With any job, the main thing is communication - you need it in the military and likewise you need that here as a project manager for EDF."" She said out of 120 people working in site operations, about 60% were ex-military. ""There's always some fun and games - the RAF always lose out at the end of the day in any argument. It's all done in good humour,"" she added. Liverpudlian Peter Henderson is working as a grinder for a Belgian contractor, Socea Denys.  He cleans the seals of 40ft (12m) metal pipe edges before they are coupled and welded together. These 17-tonne pipes are for the water cooling system of the nuclear reactors. He said: ""There's a lot of men working on the project - although the site is absolutely massive the space that we work in is small, with joiners, steel fixers, concrete pourers. ""You put a massive pipe in and the steel fixers have got to fix the steel, the chippies have to put the wood in so the concrete can get poured and that fixes our pipes."" As the project gets busier with about 6,000 workers building the power station, all the rooms will be opened up at Sedgemoor Campus. The campus has an expected lifespan of eight years - after this, as it is a modular build, it can be dismantled to allow for new developments.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-47718991,2019-03-31

Pre-application discussions with Sedgemoor Council have taken place over 163 extra caravan pitches at Mill Farm. But councillors fear that the increase in the workforce could put pressure on the area's housing and education services. When the power station plan was first approved, EDF predicted the workforce would peak  . Of the proposed pitches on the Fiddington campsite, 102 will accommodate static caravans and 61 will be for touring caravans. The   was told the plans also include a new leisure centre and café. Somerset County Council has promised to negotiate with EDF Energy to secure further financial contributions towards projects in the area. The council's strategic manager for infrastructure programmes, Andy Coupé, said workers moving to the area with family could put pressure on education facilities. ""Accurate information remains challenging about the number and location of workforce children in the area.""

14,Communities near Hinkley Point C to get £20m,"Energy company EDF has increased the amount in its community fund from £1m following criticism from local authorities. But the chief executive of Sedgemoor District Council says the money is not enough. EDF's Richard Mayson said the increase followed comment from the public and councils.  He said: ""At the time we looked around at what other large projects in the UK had done - various airport proposals over the last few years - and they were typically doing proposals of around £1m for these sorts of funds.  ""We listened very hard to the reaction of stage two consultation that obviously a lot of people recognise the economic benefits of the project but clearly a lot would like to see a decent-sized sum of money to address those other impacts of the project."" Mr Mayson said the £20m would be spent locally on projects chosen by the community and councils.  The company says it is expecting to spend £300m in total on mitigating the impact of the project, including £100m on benefiting the community. But Kerry Rickards, chief executive of the Conservative-run Sedgemoor District Council, said he felt more money could be made available. ""The Shetlands Community Trust has a fund of £150m set up now and they use that for a whole set of priorities that the communities have determined are their priorities,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-12577637,2011-02-25

The power station will provide 25,000 jobs during the construction phase. A final decision is expected in the coming months, after which the contracts will be signed. France's EDF Energy is leading the consortium to build Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which was given the go-ahead in October 2013.  It was one of eight places initially identified in England and Wales as potential sites for new nuclear power stations. The two reactors at Hinkley will provide power for about 60 years. It is hoped the plant will meet about 7% of the UK's demand. EDF said the companies had won preferred bidder status after an ""open and fair competition"". The company has estimated that more than 60% of the construction cost will be placed with UK firms, against an initial estimate of 57%. Out of the 25,000 jobs provided during construction, about 1,000 will be apprenticeships. EDF Energy chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz, said: ""Hinkley Point C will be at the forefront of the revitalisation of the UK's industrial and skills base, and we have worked hard to build a robust supply chain to support new nuclear in the UK. ""The project will boost industrial stamina in the UK and kick-start the new nuclear programme.

18,Hinkley Point C and the implications for Wales,"But what are the implications of Hinkley Point C for south Wales, with Barry only 14 miles (22.5km) across the Bristol Channel and Cardiff 19 miles (30.5km) away? The  was announced at a news conference by Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Excavation work has already started on this third reactor to be built on the coast. It could lead to thousands of construction jobs that could benefit Wales too.  But there are environmental implications as well, not least that radioactive waste could be stored on site for between 100 to 160 years.  That is the prospect at least until a safe long term nuclear depositary site has been identified to take all of the UK's historical nuclear waste - currently at Sellafield - as well as the new radioactive waste from the new fleet of power plants including Wylfa Newydd, Oldbury and Sizewell. Nigel Cann, construction director for EDF Energy at Hinkley Point C, said as well as 14m high sea walls the plant was designed to survive collision with aircraft. ""We build in margins of safety - for 10,000 years and extra for issues like global warming,"" he said. He said 850,000 working hours had gone into the engineering and there was a ""robust"" independent regulatory process to ensure the design ""was safe and provided reassurance to the public"". EDF Energy says the design: The cooling systems will need very little intervention from humans. ""We take management of radioactive fuel hugely seriously and we understand the expectations on us as an operator is to make sure we do everything to the highest levels of safety,"" said Mr Cann.  Once the finance is confirmed, it will take 10 years and 10 million tonnes of concrete - that is 75 times the amount used to build Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. There will be work opportunities for Welsh construction companies; some workers are already commuting over the Severn Bridge. But nuclear energy sceptics point to two EDF plants which are currently behind schedule and over budget in Finland and France.  Greenpeace has been campaigning vigorously against nuclear power because it claims ""it's an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity"". It  s over state aid to Hinkley Point C. Prof Karen Henwood, a social sciences expert at Cardiff University has studied communities close to big nuclear projects.  ""Technical considerations mean that people can be quite on the back foot because they feel uneasy they don't have enough knowledge,"" she said. ""And there are differing ethical voices to be heard."" In Wales, despite Trawsfynydd and Wylfa sites, there has been a long standing opposition to nuclear power.  Cor Cochion Caerdydd - the Cardiff Red Choir - protest most weekends about issues, including distrust of nuclear power Choir member Paul Relph said: ""It's never been proved it's completely safe and my other concern is nuclear waste - we're leaving it for future generations, it's just wrong,"" he said. For the UK government, it is pursuing a mixed energy strategy to avoid possible power shortages in future.  At the same time, a quarter of Britain's old power plants are to be decommissioned during the next 10 years - and reliable, secure replacement power has to be found.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34581939,2015-10-21

EDF said it was disappointed as the terms and conditions were ""superior"" within the UK construction industry. In June, a ballot for strike action was averted after an interim agreement on bonus payments was agreed. This agreement was extended into September, while both sides hoped to reach a permanent agreement. The union says one of the issues is that the pay rates for workers on civil engineering contracts are ""significantly below"" the rates of workers covered by the mechanical and engineering (M&E) contract. Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""Members have made their views clear; the unions warned the amount of money being offered was not sufficient and this has proved to be the case.

21,Hinkley Point C nuclear emissions 'underestimated',"The Stop Hinkley group said reactors will discharge more radioactive waste into the Severn Estuary. The group's complaint relates to three permits issued by the Environment Agency for the running of the plant. But the agency said it had addressed concerns before issuing the permits. A decision on whether the plant will be built is expected on Tuesday. The permits cover the discharge and disposal of radioactive waste and cooling water. Stop Hinkley said its concerns were raised during the consultation process in December 2011 but were not answered in full by the agency.  The campaign group said it commissioned independent consultants to review the methods used to assess the environmental impacts of radioactive emissions, and found they would not be sufficient or wide-ranging enough to discover the effects on the marine environment. Campaigner, Nikki Clarke said: ""It's about the routine emissions of radioactive liquid and gas from the station, day-in, day-out. ""The reactors that they want to build, the fuel that goes into them is hotter and more dirty and more dangerous than the fuel currently loaded into the Hinkley B station. ""The concerns that we have raised should have been addressed in a satisfactory way, before the granting of the permits, but all they (the agency) are doing is rubber-stamping and facilitating the government policy, and ignoring every other voice."" Stop Hinkley jointly handed in its submissions to the EA with the Nuclear Free Authorities (NFLA) and other organisations.  In a statement the Environment Agency denied the campaign group's claims. ""We came to our decisions to issue the Hinkley Point C permits only after careful consideration of all the responses we received following the two periods of public consultation,"" a spokesperson for the agency said.  ""We are surprised that Stop Hinkley says we haven't addressed the NFLA's points. ""There is an entire section in our final decision document specifically dedicated to the NFLA's comments."" The agency also denied that the methodology used to assess the radioactive impact was inadequate. Stop Hinkley is now calling for the permits to be revoked and for its submissions to be answered in full before they can be re-issued. The agency said: ""We believe we have answered their submissions in full and there is no reason why we should revoke or reconsider the permits we have issued.""",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-21827409,2013-03-18
22,Hinkley Point C excavations unearth bones from the Dark Ages,"The discovery is one of many by archaeologists who have spent years excavating ground where Hinkley Point C is being built in Somerset. Flint tools dating from the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods and Roman building remains were also found. All the results of the dig, which began in 2012, are being revealed in an exhibition at the Museum of Somerset. As part of the planning process for the power plant, the law required the digs take place in order to establish the ""likely impacts on the historic environment"". Last week more heavy machinery began arriving at Hinkley Point C to begin the groundworks for the new nuclear power station which, according to estimates, will cost £24.5bn. The project is being led by EDF Energy. Further work is being carried out on the site where the Dark Ages cemetery was unearthed and the remains will be curated by the South West Heritage Trust. It will take several years to clean, identify and document all the finds which will also be deposited with the trust.  Trust member Councillor David Hall said the discoveries will help uncover ""the remnants of a complex story"".  He said: ""Believe me - there have been some surprising finds. ""For those who know the area well, and for those who are new to it, the exhibition is an important chance to understand more about Somerset's rich past."" The exhibition is running at the Museum of Somerset, at Taunton Castle, until 11 April.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-30849222,2015-01-16
23,An Taisce bid to take Hinkley Point C legal challenge to European courts,"An Taisce is contesting the legality of granting consent for Hinkley Point C, 150 miles (240km) from the Irish coast. It claims under EU directives, Irish people should have been consulted about the environmental risks beforehand. At a hearing in London, its lawyers said the case should be referred to the European courts. In March 2013, Energy Secretary Ed Davey gave EDF Energy planning consent to build Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast. But An Taisce claim the government failed to undertake a ""transboundary consultation"" with the Irish people as required by the European Commission's Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The government says that such consultation was not necessary because nuclear accidents are not sufficiently likely due to the robustness of the UK regulatory regime Earlier, at the start of a two-day judicial review hearing in London, David Wolfe QC, for An Taisce, told the appeal judges the case turned on issues of European Union law. He said the appropriate course was a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-28316530,2014-07-15
24,Hinkley Point C nuclear power station workers stage mass sit-in,"Workers employed by at the EDF Energy site claim they had not been paid for days when snow stopped work last week. The BBC understands local managers offered some pay but this was rejected as being too low. EDF Energy says those sent home would be paid in line with agreements signed with trade unions. Some 2,000 people are working on the site but were sent home on Thursday. Hundreds are now sitting in at the site canteen. One worker told the BBC: ""We got kicked off site last Thursday because of the snow. We couldn't go home. We had to report in each day.  ""I stayed in digs for four days. I was meant to be on shift Thursday to Sunday, but I'm not being paid for the weekend, just Thursday and Friday."" Many of the workers are represented by the Unite trade union, which said it was in talks with EDF to try to resolve the unofficial dispute. An EDF spokesman said: ""The majority of the Hinkley Point C workforce are working as normal today.  ""A smaller number of workers are disputing payments for bad weather and they are being encouraged to return to work. ""Employees who were unable to work at the site during recent bad weather will be paid in line with agreements signed with the trade unions.  ""The safety of our workforce is paramount and a decision was made to close the site on Thursday ahead of the bad weather.

25,Temporary jetty at Hinkley Point C in Somerset approved,"The company behind the plans, EDF Energy, said it welcomed the decision. The 500-metre long structure would be used to bring in materials during the construction of the proposed new nuclear power station, if approved. The approval of the jetty does not have any bearing on whether the new power station itself will get the go ahead. EDF Energy said it would take down the jetty and restore the area to its original condition if permission for the new reactors was not granted.  A company statement said the the temporary jetty will allow ""significant volumes of construction materials to be delivered by sea"" in a bid to minimise traffic on local roads.  ""One sea vessel alone will avoid up to 250 heavy goods vehicles using the local road network,"" the statement continued. Richard Mayson, from EDF Energy Nuclear New Build, said he was pleased the applications, which were submitted in December 2010, had been given the go ahead. ""It will make a considerable contribution towards mitigating the impact of the station's construction on the local community. ""[The] decisions mark another important step in the right direction.""  Work on the jetty will start as soon as possible and will take about 15 months to build.

West Somerset Council voted to turn down plans to increase the number of homes to 66 - the second such request since approval was granted. Strongvox has appealed against the council's decision. Financial issues have caused delays in completing the site, since permission for 55 homes was granted, with only 39 homes being constructed to date, according to the   (LDRS). Councillor Susan Goss criticised the ""over-development"" of the site, arguing: ""This does not fulfil the needs of the people who live there.

28,Earplugs to combat Hinkley Point C construction noise,"A £2,640 grant to pay for ""bespoke earplugs"" for residents near Hinkley Point C in Somerset has been approved by the local council cabinet. Energy firm EDF has already paid for new double-glazing in some homes. But councillors said outdoor noise was ""very obtrusive"" and further measures were needed. EDF began moving heavy machinery onto the site at the beginning of January. It said excavation work to prepare the ground for the new plant will involve removing the equivalent of four Wembley Stadiums-worth of soil. West Somerset Councillor Sue Goss, who proposed the earplugs, said the noise was ""24/7"" and ""very obtrusive"" but developers EDF Energy said it was within the required limits. ""EDF has acknowledged there is a noise issue in the hamlets closest to the site by providing double glazing to all affected properties,"" she said. ""Unfortunately the double-glazing doesn't extend to the outside of people's properties, where the noise is very obtrusive."" But an EDF spokesman said the firm monitored and controlled site noise levels ""very carefully"" and has complied with the limits placed on it. ""We have developed a package of measures to support our neighbours during the construction of Hinkley Point C and these go well beyond statutory requirements."" The measure, which is recommended for approval, will go before a full council meeting next week. If approved, funding for the earplugs will come from a fund set up by EDF for local residents.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-31732169,2015-03-13
29,Hinkley Point C grant deal set at £3.2m per year,"The deal, totalling £128m, will last for 40 years, which is the planned lifetime of Hinkley Point C. Somerset County and West Somerset councils will get the money but will also share it with Sedgemoor council. The government package is separate to the £100m pledged by the developer, EDF Energy, to build infrastructure. All three councils in Somerset have welcomed the fund and local communities will decide how the money is spent. Energy minister Michael Fallon said: ""It's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs, investment and use of local services."" Theo Simon, from Stop Hinkley Campaign, said: ""It looks to me this is another case of trying to ease the way for this project which is in quite deep water and I'm not sure will be carried through anyway. ""It's not a lot of money - it's talked about as if it's a sort of compensation or reward, but it's really an acknowledgement that people in Somerset still feel profoundly unhappy about the whole plan for Hinkley C.  ""Rather than seeing it as compensation we should see it as a social bribe."" Although approval has been given, the project has stalled as EDF Energy is still in talks with ministers over what it can charge for the amount of electricity it will generate at Hinkley Point C. For about the first 10 years the government money will be made up of business rates retained locally. Cash in the second phase, from 2030-2060, will come directly from the Department for Energy and Climate Change. ""Projects of this size and complexity have an impact on local areas, it is only fair that they should see a sizeable sum to compensate them,"" said John Osman, leader of the county council.  The sum has been based on the amount of energy the power station generates - up to 1,000/MW per annum for up to 40 years. Previously Sedgemoor District Council had been arguing for the funding to be activated during the construction phase but this was rejected by the government in May, although it was recommended by a select committee looking into the issue. Under an agreement to build and run the facility, EDF Energy is set to give £64m which will be used for education, training, transport and housing.  The firm has also given a further £30m to local services for site preparation works, which started in February last year. Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Whilst wind farms and even shale gas developers have to pay community benefits, only nuclear stations will get a fat taxpayer subsidy to fund them.  ""Our entire energy policy is now absurdly distorted by the desperation to prop up EDF's faltering Hinkley C project, with the Government piling the costs on to the taxpayer to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they backed the wrong technology.

30,Hinkley Point C power station building contract delayed,"EDF Energy was due to announce this week the winner of the main contract, worth more than £1bn, to build Hinkley Point C but that will now not happen. Anti-nuclear energy protesters have claimed it puts a question mark over the whole project. An EDF spokesman said the company was ""on track to deliver what is needed for the UK"". Crispin Aubrey, from the Stop Hinkley group, said the delay could be for up to a year. He said: ""The cost of the project has risen to £14bn, that's a 40% increase on what it was a couple of years ago, and other companies looking at the economics, like the German companies RW and E.On, have already pulled out of plans to build one at Oldbury up the coast. ""So other people are saying 'let's forget it', EDF are now having to look at their own books and may well come to the decision 'let's forget about it' as well."" EDF Energy said it did not comment on active tenders. ""However, we can say that we expect to be able to make an announcement to take forward this particular contract soon,"" the spokesman said. ""The procurement process is on track, and has always assumed that certain contracts would be signed once we make our final investment decision. This has not changed. ""To date contracts worth a total in excess of £750m have been let to over 370 companies."" Meanwhile, Energy Minister Lord Marland has told the House of Lords a decision on whether or not to approve the plans for Hinkley Point C will be made by March next year.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-18255416,2012-05-29
31,Hinkley Point C: Nuclear project's 400 jobs at risk,"Developers EDF Energy has announced it will not begin the next phase of work until it has made a final investment decision on the whole project. The firm said the jobs would not be axed as a consultation and a redeployment programme would be set up. Some 250 contractors who work alongside EDF staff will remain. Unions have said a 45-day consultation for redundancy has been launched. National officer for the GMB, Phil Whitehurst, said: ""The problem seems to be the stalled final investment decision. ""This is the second time this process has been initiated by EDF. Questions now need to be answered by the French government-owned company whether they will complete the new build.  ""This should now be a wake-up call for the next UK government to take charge and manage the failing energy policy we have in place."" Another union, Unite, called for the final investment decision to be announced and for the government resolve the issues facing Hinkley Point as ""a matter of urgency"". There are currently 800 staff on site. For several months, preparation works have been taking place such as building earthworks, drainage works, concrete production facilities and culvert construction - where water channels are built to move water around the site - but now this is nearing completion. EDF said the second phase was being delayed as it would ""require a substantial increase in spending levels"". A spokesman added: ""In the meantime, work to ensure the project's readiness will continue, including project planning, engineering design and commercial supply chain activities."" Meanwhile, the company has said its talks with its investors are ""making positive progress"". In October 2013, chancellor George Osborne   with two state-owned Chinese companies, China General Nuclear Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation. If those talks are successful the Chinese investors could end up with a 30% stake in the nuclear build.  Talks are also continuing with a third investor, Areva, which may secure up to 10% ownership.

33,New nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C is approved,"Energy Secretary Ed Davey told MPs in the Commons that he was granting planning consent for French energy giant EDF to construct Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The proposed £14bn power plant would be capable of powering five million homes. Mr Davey said the project was ""of crucial national importance"" but environmental groups reacted angrily.  The building of Hinkley Point C is expected to pave the way for a fleet of new plants across the UK.  It is estimated the project will create between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent jobs once in operation. BBC industry correspondent John Moylan said the power plant would cost more than the London 2012 Olympics. Mr Davey told the Commons: ""The planning decision to give consent to Hinkley Point follows a rigorous examination from the Planning Inspectorate, and detailed analysis within my department. ""This planned project adds to a number of new energy projects consented since May 2010, including wind farms and biomass and gas-fired power stations. ""It will benefit the local economy, through direct employment, the supply chain and the use of local services."" The news is a boost to the nuclear industry following a series of setbacks in plans to construct a new fleet of reactors in the UK, which ministers say are needed to cut carbon and keep the lights on. EDF says the project would generate taxes equivalent to a few percentage points of what the entire financial sector yields for the exchequer. The energy giant is negotiating with ministers over what it can charge for the electricity Hinkley generates for decades to come. Mr Davey said discussions on the strike price were ongoing, but he expected them to be concluded shortly. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said ""intensive discussions"" were taking place. He said: ""To make this opportunity a reality, we need to reach agreement swiftly...  It must offer a fair and balanced deal for consumers and investors."" Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint welcomed the decision to grant planning consent. ""Today's announcement is an important milestone in the development of new nuclear build in the UK,"" she said.  ""I am pleased to welcome it and reiterate our support for nuclear power alongside an expansion of renewable energy and investment in carbon capture and storage as part of a clean, secure and affordable energy supply for the future."" However, environmental groups have reacted angrily. They raised concerns over the potentially high price for electricity the government will agree to in order to get the nuclear plant built, and over the issue of nuclear waste. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""It will lock a generation of consumers into higher energy bills, via a strike price that's expected to be double the current price of electricity, and it will distort energy policy by displacing newer, cleaner, cheaper technologies. ""With companies now saying the price of offshore wind will drop so much it will be on par with nuclear by 2020, there is no rationale for allowing Hinkley C to proceed."" Friends of the Earth's Policy and Campaigns Director Craig Bennett said: ""The only way this plant will be built is if the government hands over a blank cheque from UK taxpayers to French developers, EDF.  ""The most cost-effective way to cut carbon and keep the lights on is a combination of energy efficiency and investing in renewables."" Hinkley C would be one of the UK's biggest infrastructure projects for years with 5,600 workers on site at the peak of construction. Unite's national officer for energy Kevin Coyne, said the decision to grant consent was a ""massive boost for jobs"". But Dr Tim Fox, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, warned of a potential shortage of skilled engineers needed to build the plant. ""More needs to be done to increase the number of people choosing engineering as a career to overcome a skills shortage,"" he said. ""Over the next 10 years, the UK needs to be recruiting about 87,000 engineers a year, but worryingly we are currently producing just 46,000 engineers a year.""   Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear plant at the site. Hinkley A, which is now being decommissioned, began generating in 1965 and was closed down in 1999.  Hinkley B, which started generating in 1976, is due to be turned off in 2023. The last nuclear plant built in the UK was Sizewell B in Suffolk.  Building work for the plant, near Leiston, began in 1988 and it started operating seven years later.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21839684,2013-03-20
34,Hinkley Point C: Decision widens chasm in local opinion,"Energy Secretary Ed Davey has approved the construction of Hinkley Point C by French energy company EDF. Somerset County Council's deputy leader welcomed the decision saying it will ""unlock tremendous opportunities, including thousands of new jobs"". But members of Stop Hinkley campaign called it ""a political scandal"". ""EDF don't know what they will do with the radioactive waste Hinkley C would produce, they don't have the investment they need now that Centrica have pulled out, and they have threatened to walk away unless the government underwrite their costs and fix the nuclear electricity price artificially high for consumers,"" said Theo Simon of the Stop Hinkley campaign.  ""I don't think anyone in West Somerset believed that the public consultation last year was anything more than an elaborate, undemocratic, sham and that in itself is a political scandal. ""We need clean, green, 21st-century solutions to 21st-century problems, not a toxic white elephant only kept alive by government bailouts and inflated electricity bills,"" said Mr Simon. But Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, who represents Bridgwater, called the announcement ""a very good day for Britain and a phenomenally good day in Bridgwater and West Somerset."" Conservative David Hall, deputy leader at Somerset County Council, echoed the MP's sentiments calling it ""an exciting time"" and a ""huge opportunity"". ""It is the chance of a lifetime and could regenerate a huge area and create jobs and opportunities for our young people for years to come,"" said Mr Hall. He said Hinkley Point C will provide a ""supply chain investment and a large number of apprenticeships for our young people"". In West Somerset, which will host the facility, the leader of the district council, Conservative Tim Taylor said: ""We already have a series of programmes in place providing all sorts of opportunities for local businesses to benefit from being in the supply chain and local people to be trained to become part of a skilled workforce.""  But in Sedgemoor, which is home to the communities surrounding Hinkley, there was a reminder for the government to ensure ""fair, reasonable, and proportionate benefits in recognition of the burden of hosting a power station which will deliver great benefits to the nation but whose significant impact is felt locally.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-21849253,2013-03-19
35,Hinkley Point C nuclear go-ahead: Reaction from Somerset,"Some business leaders and politicians claimed the nuclear plant, just outside Bridgwater in Somerset, will lead to an economic boom for the area. Initial estimates from Somerset County Council claimed the regional economy is set to benefit by around £4bn.

Leader of Somerset County Council John Osman said the decision is a ""once in a generation"" opportunity and will ""bring unprecedented investment and job creation to the county and the wider region"".  Councillor David Hall, cabinet member for business and inward investment, said the plants will be the catalyst for economic growth in Somerset: ""During construction alone, the project is expected to bring £200m to the local economy.""  Roy Pumphrey of the Stop Hinkley Campaign said ""Bridgwater will not know what has hit it when, and if, the real work on the power station should it ever start, begins.  ""Once the thousands of vans, hundreds of buses... are all on the roads Bridgwater will become a no go area as far as access is concerned. Speaking on BBC Somerset Emma Gibson from Greenpeace said: ""I don't think it's over. The deal may still unravel and cause a great deal of concern for the people of Somerset. ""There is huge uncertainty around this project...it's better to invest in renewable energy - it's cheaper and more reliable."" However, councillor Leigh Redman, from Bridgwater Town & Sedgemoor District Council, said ""Hinkley Point C should be welcomed for the good it will bring our town, but we should be compensated where necessary for inconvenience or negative impact.

Chief executive of Visit Somerset John Turner said the ""eyes of the world will be on Somerset"" and they are getting ready to ""welcome probably the largest workforce coming into the region"".  He added that they have ""worked very hard with other local government bodies over many years to ensure that Somerset gains the most out of the this project"". Professor Tom Scott, co-director of the South West Nuclear Hub and Nuclear Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said the decision will ""support the UK nuclear renaissance"".

36,Hinkley Point C plant 'could cost Bridgwater economy £47m',"The figure was quoted by Sedgemoor District Council at a Planning Inspectorate public meeting earlier.  EDF Energy submitted plans for the Hinkley Point C plant to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) last October.  The company says the overall impact on the economy will be positive. Doug Bamsey, from Sedgemoor District Council, said it was ""very important"" that organisations which deliver food and other ""vital supplies"" were not affected. ""We all know that congestion is a factor that people consider in terms of where they locate their business,"" he said. The meeting, in Bridgwater, also heard that businesses and tourists could avoid the area because of clogged up roads. David Eccles from EDF, said the company was producing a ""massive opportunity in terms of economic development for the region"". ""A rising tide lifts all ships,"" he said. ""We'll be putting £100m into the economy locally for every year of construction and £40m for every year of operation. ""And that's a lot of money in anybody's language.""

37,Hinkley Point C construction 'should be delayed until 2019',"Investment in Hinkley Point C should be held until 2019 so problems with a similar reactor design in France are solved, the CFE-CGC Energy Union said.  It comes after French firm EDF Energy   in principle last year, to invest in the Somerset site. Unions occupy six of the 18 seats on the board of EDF, which is yet to vote on a  . The £18bn project has been plagued by delays, but publicly the firm has insisted a decision to move forward is imminent. Speaking at the EDF annual presentation of accounts last month, chairman Jean-Bernard Levy said the final investment decision was ""just ahead of us"", but he did not give an exact date. The Hinkley C story has been a rollercoaster - with little sign of a less bumpy ride around the corner. The company's problem is that it has made too many pronouncements of a final investment decision being ""soon."" Many deadlines have come and gone. And each time nerves jangle a little more among those who say the nuclear project is vital to the economic prosperity of the West. Locally, many millions of pounds have been spent on new roads, new training centres, new offices.  Companies in and around Somerset have been gearing up for the development, which has promised 25,000 new jobs in the construction phase alone. There are many who say that too much has been invested for Hinkley not to happen now.  But in France, it seems there are influential voices now trying to derail the new nuclear train. Francis Raillott, of CFE-CGC, which has two seats on the EDF board, said investment should not be made until problems surrounding a project in Flamanville, France - which is years behind schedule and millions of Euros over budget - have been solved.  ""Right now, Hinkley is too risky for the company,"" he said.  ""We think it is better to wait and see. Wait for three years so we can see that everything works... or not."" An EDF spokesman said: ""Final steps are well in hand to enable the full construction phase [at Hinkley] to be launched very soon."" Hinkley is due to start generating power in 2025, and is expected to provide 7% of the UK's electricity once it is running.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-35689784,2016-03-01
38,Hinkley Point C: Building challenges,"Although questions remain over the electricity price needed to fund its construction, the challenge to build the power station could soon get under way. So what are the next steps and why will it take up to 10 years? Hinkley Point C will contain two nuclear reactors and will be based alongside Hinkley A and B. There are two main aspects to the project - building the nuclear power station itself and getting the infrastructure in place. Permission for the site preparation works was granted in July and involves clearing a valley to the west of the existing nuclear power station.  This work has not yet been completed. EDF Energy has said it will not comment on a specific timescale for the project but these are some of the challenges that lie ahead: Some agreements are in place already and include getting the Cannington bypass built in the first two years as the high volume of construction traffic starts to flow. But there are a number of other measures which include: All of these road and infrastructure improvements are set to take between one and two years. The nuclear power station site will cover about 170 hectares (420 acres). Among the main elements are two UK European pressurised water (EPR) reactors, turbine halls and an electricity substation. Alistair Smith, the chairman of the power division at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, has described the build as ""the equivalent of building all the facilities for the London Olympics"". He said: ""It would take about nine months to get the site mobilised to get the earthworks to prepare the ground.  ""There's about three million cubic metres of earth to be moved and that's got to happen before the main construction teams can come in and they've got to build some tunnels to take the cooling water and bring the cooling water out.  ""Those are over 3km long and so there is a huge tunnelling contract to be done and then you can start putting down foundations for the main construction."" Once the construction workers have taken the build to ground level, the next step is the more complex stage of building the reactors.  This is likely to start sometime in 2014, with mechanical and electrical works to start mid-2015. This will be followed by about nine months to one year of testing before it can start producing electricity. The first reactor is set to be operational by 2020, with the second ready by 2024, although delays can happen. During peak construction the project will employ about 5,600 workers.  So far 1,000 local companies have registered to the EDF supply chain and are going through the accreditation process. ""Each person has to be suitably checked for security, they have to be trained and brought on to site and have accommodation found for them. ""They've got to be induced into the way that they work on a site,"" added Mr Smith. ""When you have got such a complex site you have many different disciplines working alongside each other.  ""It has to be a very well-planned project so every day you've got to know exactly what you're doing in relation to all the other contractors working round you.

Plans for the station could be published within 28 days, when the public can comment on them. If the Localism Bill is enacted in Parliament, the IPC will make a recommendation to the energy secretary, who will have the final say. If the station is granted permission, it could be online by 2020 and provide enough energy for five million homes. However, the project has been criticised by campaigners who claim nuclear power stations are dangerous. The Stop Hinkley campaign said: ""We need to follow the German lead as soon as possible and build a clean, safe, renewable future.""  The site's current Hinkley Point B came into service in 1976 but its working life has been extended to 2016.

49,Sedgemoor District Council's Hinkley Point concerns,"The council has sent a report to the Infrastructure Planning Commission which deals with large-scale projects. A decline in tourism, a loss in quality of life and house price increases due to extra demand from newly created jobs have been cited as worrying issues. An EDF spokesman said the Hinkley Point C project would bring ""both benefits and some disruption"" to the area. ""We are committed to working with the community and local authorities to maximise the benefits and mitigate the impacts as far as practical,"" he said. The government will make the final decision on EDF Energy's proposals after considering the recommendation made by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) which is looking at the planning application. As part of the planning process, the authority is submitting its views on the overall development to the IPC. Ten broad topics have been listed as areas of concern, including the effect on housing and the local economy, the risks relating to nuclear power and the environmental impact. The council said it was also worried ""the attention given to places and settlements is poor"", in particular to Bridgwater, which it felt would be most affected by the scheme, in terms of increased traffic and quality of life. It said more could be done to invest in the regeneration of Bridgwater and improve access to skills and learning for young people. Concerns were also highlighted over the way EDF was ""slicing up"" different aspects of the project, such as the site preparation works, so it would be harder to assess the full impact of the project on the environment. A statement from EDF said the company expected to spend £300m ""mitigating the impacts of the project and providing community benefit"". ""Of this, £100m should be of lasting benefit to the community beyond the construction of the plant,"" it said.

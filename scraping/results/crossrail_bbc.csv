0,Crossrail: Elizabeth line due to open on 24 May,"The Abbey Wood to Paddington section will open to passengers on 24 May, although initially trains will not run on Sundays or call at Bond Street. Known as the Elizabeth line, it was meant to start running in December 2018 but the £18.8bn project has missed multiple targets amid ballooning costs. The railway will  Once the route is open, services in the central London section will run every five minutes between 06:30 BST and 23:00, although a full timetable will not be in place until May 2023. The new line will slash journey times from Abbey Wood in south-east London to Paddington by almost half - to 29 minutes. Travel times between Liverpool Street and Woolwich will also be halved to 15 minutes, while a trip between Farringdon and Canary Wharf, which currently takes 24 minutes, will take 10 minutes. However, passengers wishing to travel the length of the line will still need to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street, depending on their destination, until next year. Although a special service will be in place for the Platinum Jubilee weekend, TfL said trains would not initially run on Sundays ""to allow a series of testing and software updates"". The opening date is subject to final safety approvals being granted. Previously, transport bosses   to an opening date during the first half of 2022. It is hoped the Queen - who the line is named after - will be involved when the route begins to operate. Construction of Crossrail began at Canary Wharf on 15 May 2009, with tunnelling work starting in May 2012. The project had an original budget of £14.8bn, but the government pledged an extra £4bn to help get it open. Services which are already running in the east and west sections will continue to operate every day, but they will be rebranded from TfL Rail to the Elizabeth line from 24 May. Better late than never. You can almost hear the sighs of relief at TfL. After all the problems - and there have been many - at last Crossrail has an opening date. The budget has grown from £14.8bn to £18.8bn and the opening date slipped so many times that it became hard to keep track. Some doubted it would ever open. A new management team was brought in following delay after delay. It will now open nearly four years late.  A lot of the shenanigans, I suspect, will be forgotten when people see the stations and the trains. They are very impressive and big. And if it works, the trains will be very regular - the project will increase central London rail capacity by 10%.  Not only will this be a game changer for travel in London, it'll also bring in much needed revenue for TfL.  Don't forget 70% of Crossrail was paid for by London through TfL, the Greater London Authority and its businesses and fare payers.   Now TfL has to run a good, smooth service.  London's transport commissioner Andy Byford said the next three weeks would be used ""to build up reliability on the railway and get the Elizabeth line ready to welcome customers"".  He said: ""The opening day is set to be a truly historic moment for the capital and the UK, and we look forward to showcasing a simply stunning addition to our network."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who is also chair of TfL, said the Elizabeth line would make London ""safer, fairer, greener and more prosperous"". He said: ""Green public transport is the future, and the opening of the Elizabeth line is a landmark moment for our capital and our whole country, particularly in this special Platinum Jubilee year."" But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps accused the Labour mayor of breaking pre-local election rules by announcing the opening date a day before local elections take place across London on Thursday. Mr Khan is chair of TfL, which made the announcement.  Rules restrict what communications activity can take place in the run-up to elections. Mr Shapps said: ""This announcement is an act of breath-taking political cynicism by the mayor. ""I am therefore immediately referring this breach to the Electoral Commission for investigation."" Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrat chair of London Assembly's Transport Committee, said Crossrail would ""transform travel across London"". ""While recognising the benefits that Crossrail will provide for the future we should not overlook the mistakes that have been made in the past,"" she added.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-61095510,2022-05-04
1,Elizabeth line: The ambient detailing behind Crossrail's new stations,"These are London's new Crossrail stations. Many Londoners will be surprised at the cathedrals of transport that have been built below their city. The detailing is very exact.  Close to the platforms, the stations are very, very similar. There is nice ambient lighting with only a handful of benches.  The concrete is dimpled and undecorated. Even the corners of the corridors have been designed to move people quickly. Julian Robinson is the head architect for Crossrail and he has been showing me how they designed the curved corridor corners. ""We've taken advantage of the form of the engineering behind the sprayed concrete lining,"" he tells me. ""This has enabled us to express a smooth curve rather than what you would find typically on a London Underground-style of station, a right-angle junction.  ""Because of the form of the construction, the benefit for passengers is of course as you are moving around and through you're constantly seeing there are no blind corners."" These stations are built to cope with population growth with capacity to spare. ""It's like next generation,"" Julian explains.  ""It's not a Tube line, it's a full-sized train. So part of the approach was, how do you address the difference in scale?  ""How do you make the stations work and operate for large amounts of people and high volumes of people getting on and off the trains?"" Away from the platforms, on the surface a different architect has designed every station so they will all look different.  John Toovey is an associate architect with the company BDP. He designed the Crossrail element of Whitechapel station in east London.  He shows me how they have created a bridge into the station over the existing Tube tracks. It is light and airy and it has a green roof. ""We have taken the opportunity to include natural light on both sides,"" John says. ""As you come into the station from the entrance you can see where you're going immediately. It's very clear where you are going.  ""It all happens in natural light as well, and naturally ventilated, so it all helps the wellbeing of the passenger.""  The million-dollar question is when will Crossrail open? Bosses have said by the end of June at the latest.  There are lots and lots of dates flying around, but I'm told there are two potential dates. Right now, it is all hush hush and nothing is confirmed officially.  Crossrail is over budget and very late - but the end is nearly in sight.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-61093756,2022-04-13
2,What happens to the clay from Crossrail?,"It is a wild, barren landscape with not much around apart from thousands and thousands of birds. On the Essex coast is a landscape that has been created with the help of Crossrail. This is RSPB Wallasea and it's been created from the spoil from the Crossrail tunnels. Millions and millions of tonnes of London clay were carried out here by boat. What it has done is raise the ground level of the area - it was previously fields reclaimed from the sea. Lagoons and rivers have been created with the mud which flood when the tide comes in. It is now a vital habitat for birds and creates a link between other habitats right along the east coast. Crossrail will change how many people travel in London.  Part of its legacy is this huge man-made nature reserve on the Essex coast.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60750333,2022-03-22
3,Does a practice breakdown mean Crossrail is near?,"We are told to board a train and head off towards Canary Wharf. The train is full - mainly with Transport for London (TfL) employees and their families - but it is noticeably quicker than Tube trains and feels larger. Over the Tannoy, the driver soon announces that we have ""broken down"". Despite this, everyone is in good spirits. After much coming and going from a British Transport Police officer and the driver, a rescue train is brought in and we are all marched on to that train, which takes us to Canary Wharf. Most tell me the experience goes smoothly. After 10 minutes the alarms go off and we all evacuate the station - again it is a safety drill. Transport bosses are very tight-lipped about the exact opening date; they are clearly working to a number of options before the end of June. So what does this trial evacuation show? It was a big step forward and the opening can't be far away.  Rebecca Edwards, who is in charge of the volunteers, says the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, needs to see that TfL can evacuate a train safely in order for Crossrail to receive the required safety certificates. There have been many hiccups, delays and overruns but will London now get its Elizabeth line?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60664867,2022-03-14
4,Crossrail: 'A journey from embarrassing farce to shiny railway',"It used to be a building site underground - dusty and noisy and full of miners - as the huge boring machines inched their way through the London clay. Well, today it is something very, very different - it is a brand new railway, to be known as the Elizabeth line, and it is very close to opening. I went on one of the new trains now being tested below London. It is very difficult not to be in awe of the engineering achievement as they whisk you from Paddington to Liverpool Street in 12 minutes. The stations are huge and glistening. The trains clean, bright and fast. Eventually they'll run every few minutes.  Of course we can't downplay the problems this scheme has had and the impact it has had on Londoners. It is three-and-a-half years late, and is billions over budget. The early mantra of ""on time and on budget"" disappeared into an embarrassing farce as one management team was replaced by another. I've spoken to countless businesses who have suffered due to the delays and the broken promises. The stress of the Crossrail delays has taken businesses to the brink. And it will be a while before everything is open - Bond Street station is still behind schedule. But now it seems the end is in sight and most of it will open in the next few months. Londoners will get quite a shock when they see it. It is big. It will increase rail capacity by 10% in central London and reduce congestion at other stations. It'll bring 1.5 million people to within a 45-minute journey of central London. At the moment, the scheme is carrying out ""trial operations"". They are carrying out 150 scenarios - like evacuations - to make sure the systems can cope. Of course, no-one really knows the impact working from home will have on public transport - is Crossrail and infrastructure on this scale ever going to be built again? But being on those trains as they shoot through the tunnels, after a tortuous and farcical journey - it seems the end is in sight.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60085498,2022-01-25
5,Crossrail: Warning over Woolwich station funding shortfall,"More than half of the £15m Greenwich Council is obliged to pay towards the new station at Woolwich still needs to be found. New council papers reveal only £7m has been paid towards the station. Councillors have warned of a ""looming cash crisis"" as the authority tries to find the remaining £8m. It has led to fears that the lack of cash means money meant for other building projects may need to be redirected,  Crossrail had been expected to open on the Elizabeth Line in 2018, but is now earmarked for spring 2022. In 2013, a £54m deal was reached by Greenwich Council, property developer Berkeley Homes and Transport for London to fund the Woolwich stop. At the time the new station was hailed as an opportunity to support regeneration of Woolwich and improving access to jobs. Reacting to the council papers, Greenwich Conservatives' leader, Cllr Nigel Fletcher, said: ""I've been asking for months about this looming cash crisis, and how the council will pay the bill. ""This bad deal has already diverted millions of pounds of developers' contributions that should have been spent on improving communities across the borough, and now even more of that fund will have to be raided. ""Our most deprived communities will now pay the price for the council's bad choices."" Greenwich Council said it collects money through the Community Infrastricture Levy (CIL) through certain developments in the borough. A spokesman added: ""The amount collected is continually monitored and reviewed - particularly as a result of uncertainty in the construction sector due to external factors like Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-59710650,2021-12-18
6,Crossrail CEO admits complexity 'off the scale',"Mark Wild also told the London Assembly a fixation on a December 2018 launch ""distorted everything"" and integrating 37 different contracts was challenging. Although a full timetable will not run until May 2023, the Abbey Wood to Paddington section should open in 2022. The Elizabeth line will connect Reading and Essex via central London. The project had an original budget of £14.8bn in 2010. The government increased the project's  Mr Wild told the London Assembly's transport committee the project was ""the most complex engineering effort of this century in this country"". He said: ""Crossrail was too complicated. It could have been made much simpler."" Transport for London (TfL) commissioner Andy Byford reiterated his promise to open the Abbey Wood to Paddington section in the first half of 2022. He said: ""If someone had offered me this position in mid-November 2021, I would have absolutely taken where we are now. ""It absolutely will not slip... the one caveat being that I would rather wait and spend a little bit more time on getting it right out of the box than be in a rush to open and it be unreliable.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-59305575,2021-11-16
7,Crossrail: Full timetable 'predicted in May 2023',"However, it heard the first section between Abbey Wood and Paddington should open in spring 2022. The Elizabeth line was originally due to open in December 2018 but has been  . The committee was also told the route, which will run from Reading to Essex through central London, would be mostly operational by autumn 2022. Matthew Lodge, director of Rail Infrastructure, South, said: ""If you're asking me about the full absolute final Crossrail timetable, my prediction would be May 2023. ""But you will have some of the significant benefits that Crossrail will deliver delivered early from some time after the opening of the central core in the first half of 2022,"" the Department for Transport director added. The route from Reading to Abbey Wood had an original budget of £14.8bn in 2010. The government increased the project's  There's no doubt Transport for London want Crossrail open as soon as possible - it'll ease overcrowding but it'll also bring in much-needed revenue.  But there have been so many opening dates that have come and gone that anything will be taken with a pinch of salt.  Businesses up and down the line made investments on initial opening dates only to be badly let down.  However, it seems we may get services through the central London tunnel next spring with a full opening in May 2023.  That is over four years late which makes all the previous guff that the project was ""on time and on budget"" look, frankly, embarrassing. Mark Wild, CEO of Crossrail, said there would be an end-to-end railway connecting Reading and Abbey Wood by the autumn of 2022. However, he said it could not be guaranteed that passengers coming into central London from the east of the capital would not have to change trains. He added: ""In the autumn of 2022 you would have a railway that was 90-95% of the end-to-end benefit. A further tweak is then required, probably based on National Rail timetable days, to do the final articulation of any services from the east that would go all the way through.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-57890384,2021-07-19

0,Crossrail: Elizabeth line due to open on 24 May,"The Abbey Wood to Paddington section will open to passengers on 24 May, although initially trains will not run on Sundays or call at Bond Street. Known as the Elizabeth line, it was meant to start running in December 2018 but the £18.8bn project has missed multiple targets amid ballooning costs. The railway will  Once the route is open, services in the central London section will run every five minutes between 06:30 BST and 23:00, although a full timetable will not be in place until May 2023. The new line will slash journey times from Abbey Wood in south-east London to Paddington by almost half - to 29 minutes. Travel times between Liverpool Street and Woolwich will also be halved to 15 minutes, while a trip between Farringdon and Canary Wharf, which currently takes 24 minutes, will take 10 minutes. However, passengers wishing to travel the length of the line will still need to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street, depending on their destination, until next year. Although a special service will be in place for the Platinum Jubilee weekend, TfL said trains would not initially run on Sundays ""to allow a series of testing and software updates"". The opening date is subject to final safety approvals being granted. Previously, transport bosses   to an opening date during the first half of 2022. It is hoped the Queen - who the line is named after - will be involved when the route begins to operate. Construction of Crossrail began at Canary Wharf on 15 May 2009, with tunnelling work starting in May 2012. The project had an original budget of £14.8bn, but the government pledged an extra £4bn to help get it open. Services which are already running in the east and west sections will continue to operate every day, but they will be rebranded from TfL Rail to the Elizabeth line from 24 May. Better late than never. You can almost hear the sighs of relief at TfL. After all the problems - and there have been many - at last Crossrail has an opening date. The budget has grown from £14.8bn to £18.8bn and the opening date slipped so many times that it became hard to keep track. Some doubted it would ever open. A new management team was brought in following delay after delay. It will now open nearly four years late.  A lot of the shenanigans, I suspect, will be forgotten when people see the stations and the trains. They are very impressive and big. And if it works, the trains will be very regular - the project will increase central London rail capacity by 10%.  Not only will this be a game changer for travel in London, it'll also bring in much needed revenue for TfL.  Don't forget 70% of Crossrail was paid for by London through TfL, the Greater London Authority and its businesses and fare payers.   Now TfL has to run a good, smooth service.  London's transport commissioner Andy Byford said the next three weeks would be used ""to build up reliability on the railway and get the Elizabeth line ready to welcome customers"".  He said: ""The opening day is set to be a truly historic moment for the capital and the UK, and we look forward to showcasing a simply stunning addition to our network."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who is also chair of TfL, said the Elizabeth line would make London ""safer, fairer, greener and more prosperous"". He said: ""Green public transport is the future, and the opening of the Elizabeth line is a landmark moment for our capital and our whole country, particularly in this special Platinum Jubilee year."" But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps accused the Labour mayor of breaking pre-local election rules by announcing the opening date a day before local elections take place across London on Thursday. Mr Khan is chair of TfL, which made the announcement.  Rules restrict what communications activity can take place in the run-up to elections. Mr Shapps said: ""This announcement is an act of breath-taking political cynicism by the mayor. ""I am therefore immediately referring this breach to the Electoral Commission for investigation."" Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrat chair of London Assembly's Transport Committee, said Crossrail would ""transform travel across London"". ""While recognising the benefits that Crossrail will provide for the future we should not overlook the mistakes that have been made in the past,"" she added. Follow BBC London on  ,  and  .

1,Elizabeth line: The ambient detailing behind Crossrail's new stations,"These are London's new Crossrail stations. Many Londoners will be surprised at the cathedrals of transport that have been built below their city. The detailing is very exact.  Close to the platforms, the stations are very, very similar. There is nice ambient lighting with only a handful of benches.  The concrete is dimpled and undecorated. Even the corners of the corridors have been designed to move people quickly. Julian Robinson is the head architect for Crossrail and he has been showing me how they designed the curved corridor corners. ""We've taken advantage of the form of the engineering behind the sprayed concrete lining,"" he tells me. ""This has enabled us to express a smooth curve rather than what you would find typically on a London Underground-style of station, a right-angle junction.  ""Because of the form of the construction, the benefit for passengers is of course as you are moving around and through you're constantly seeing there are no blind corners."" These stations are built to cope with population growth with capacity to spare. ""It's like next generation,"" Julian explains.  ""It's not a Tube line, it's a full-sized train. So part of the approach was, how do you address the difference in scale?  ""How do you make the stations work and operate for large amounts of people and high volumes of people getting on and off the trains?"" Away from the platforms, on the surface a different architect has designed every station so they will all look different.  John Toovey is an associate architect with the company BDP. He designed the Crossrail element of Whitechapel station in east London.  He shows me how they have created a bridge into the station over the existing Tube tracks. It is light and airy and it has a green roof. ""We have taken the opportunity to include natural light on both sides,"" John says. ""As you come into the station from the entrance you can see where you're going immediately. It's very clear where you are going.  ""It all happens in natural light as well, and naturally ventilated, so it all helps the wellbeing of the passenger.""  The million-dollar question is when will Crossrail open? Bosses have said by the end of June at the latest.  There are lots and lots of dates flying around, but I'm told there are two potential dates. Right now, it is all hush hush and nothing is confirmed officially.  Crossrail is over budget and very late - but the end is nearly in sight. Follow BBC London on  ,  and  .

2,What happens to the clay from Crossrail?,"It is a wild, barren landscape with not much around apart from thousands and thousands of birds. On the Essex coast is a landscape that has been created with the help of Crossrail. This is RSPB Wallasea and it's been created from the spoil from the Crossrail tunnels. Millions and millions of tonnes of London clay were carried out here by boat. What it has done is raise the ground level of the area - it was previously fields reclaimed from the sea. Lagoons and rivers have been created with the mud which flood when the tide comes in. It is now a vital habitat for birds and creates a link between other habitats right along the east coast. Crossrail will change how many people travel in London.  Part of its legacy is this huge man-made nature reserve on the Essex coast.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60750333,2022-03-22
3,Does a practice breakdown mean Crossrail is near?,"We are told to board a train and head off towards Canary Wharf. The train is full - mainly with Transport for London (TfL) employees and their families - but it is noticeably quicker than Tube trains and feels larger. Over the Tannoy, the driver soon announces that we have ""broken down"". Despite this, everyone is in good spirits. After much coming and going from a British Transport Police officer and the driver, a rescue train is brought in and we are all marched on to that train, which takes us to Canary Wharf. Most tell me the experience goes smoothly. After 10 minutes the alarms go off and we all evacuate the station - again it is a safety drill. Transport bosses are very tight-lipped about the exact opening date; they are clearly working to a number of options before the end of June. So what does this trial evacuation show? It was a big step forward and the opening can't be far away.  Rebecca Edwards, who is in charge of the volunteers, says the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, needs to see that TfL can evacuate a train safely in order for Crossrail to receive the required safety certificates. There have been many hiccups, delays and overruns but will London now get its Elizabeth line? ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60664867,2022-03-14
4,Crossrail: 'A journey from embarrassing farce to shiny railway',"It used to be a building site underground - dusty and noisy and full of miners - as the huge boring machines inched their way through the London clay. Well, today it is something very, very different - it is a brand new railway, to be known as the Elizabeth line, and it is very close to opening. I went on one of the new trains now being tested below London. It is very difficult not to be in awe of the engineering achievement as they whisk you from Paddington to Liverpool Street in 12 minutes. The stations are huge and glistening. The trains clean, bright and fast. Eventually they'll run every few minutes.  Of course we can't downplay the problems this scheme has had and the impact it has had on Londoners. It is three-and-a-half years late, and is billions over budget. The early mantra of ""on time and on budget"" disappeared into an embarrassing farce as one management team was replaced by another. I've spoken to countless businesses who have suffered due to the delays and the broken promises. The stress of the Crossrail delays has taken businesses to the brink. And it will be a while before everything is open - Bond Street station is still behind schedule. But now it seems the end is in sight and most of it will open in the next few months. Londoners will get quite a shock when they see it. It is big. It will increase rail capacity by 10% in central London and reduce congestion at other stations. It'll bring 1.5 million people to within a 45-minute journey of central London. At the moment, the scheme is carrying out ""trial operations"". They are carrying out 150 scenarios - like evacuations - to make sure the systems can cope. Of course, no-one really knows the impact working from home will have on public transport - is Crossrail and infrastructure on this scale ever going to be built again? But being on those trains as they shoot through the tunnels, after a tortuous and farcical journey - it seems the end is in sight. Follow BBC London on  ,  and  .

5,Crossrail: Warning over Woolwich station funding shortfall,"More than half of the £15m Greenwich Council is obliged to pay towards the new station at Woolwich still needs to be found. New council papers reveal only £7m has been paid towards the station. Councillors have warned of a ""looming cash crisis"" as the authority tries to find the remaining £8m. It has led to fears that the lack of cash means money meant for other building projects may need to be redirected,  Crossrail had been expected to open on the Elizabeth Line in 2018, but is now earmarked for spring 2022. In 2013, a £54m deal was reached by Greenwich Council, property developer Berkeley Homes and Transport for London to fund the Woolwich stop. At the time the new station was hailed as an opportunity to support regeneration of Woolwich and improving access to jobs. Reacting to the council papers, Greenwich Conservatives' leader, Cllr Nigel Fletcher, said: ""I've been asking for months about this looming cash crisis, and how the council will pay the bill. ""This bad deal has already diverted millions of pounds of developers' contributions that should have been spent on improving communities across the borough, and now even more of that fund will have to be raided. ""Our most deprived communities will now pay the price for the council's bad choices."" Greenwich Council said it collects money through the Community Infrastricture Levy (CIL) through certain developments in the borough. A spokesman added: ""The amount collected is continually monitored and reviewed - particularly as a result of uncertainty in the construction sector due to external factors like Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-59710650,2021-12-18
6,Crossrail CEO admits complexity 'off the scale',"Mark Wild also told the London Assembly a fixation on a December 2018 launch ""distorted everything"" and integrating 37 different contracts was challenging. Although a full timetable will not run until May 2023, the Abbey Wood to Paddington section should open in 2022. The Elizabeth line will connect Reading and Essex via central London. The project had an original budget of £14.8bn in 2010. The government increased the project's  Mr Wild told the London Assembly's transport committee the project was ""the most complex engineering effort of this century in this country"". He said: ""Crossrail was too complicated. It could have been made much simpler."" Transport for London (TfL) commissioner Andy Byford reiterated his promise to open the Abbey Wood to Paddington section in the first half of 2022. He said: ""If someone had offered me this position in mid-November 2021, I would have absolutely taken where we are now. ""It absolutely will not slip... the one caveat being that I would rather wait and spend a little bit more time on getting it right out of the box than be in a rush to open and it be unreliable.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-59305575,2021-11-16

The committee was also told the route, which will run from Reading to Essex through central London, would be mostly operational by autumn 2022. Matthew Lodge, director of Rail Infrastructure, South, said: ""If you're asking me about the full absolute final Crossrail timetable, my prediction would be May 2023. ""But you will have some of the significant benefits that Crossrail will deliver delivered early from some time after the opening of the central core in the first half of 2022,"" the Department for Transport director added. The route from Reading to Abbey Wood had an original budget of £14.8bn in 2010. The government increased the project's  There's no doubt Transport for London want Crossrail open as soon as possible - it'll ease overcrowding but it'll also bring in much-needed revenue.  But there have been so many opening dates that have come and gone that anything will be taken with a pinch of salt.  Businesses up and down the line made investments on initial opening dates only to be badly let down.  However, it seems we may get services through the central London tunnel next spring with a full opening in May 2023.  That is over four years late which makes all the previous guff that the project was ""on time and on budget"" look, frankly, embarrassing. Mark Wild, CEO of Crossrail, said there would be an end-to-end railway connecting Reading and Abbey Wood by the autumn of 2022. However, he said it could not be guaranteed that passengers coming into central London from the east of the capital would not have to change trains. He added: ""In the autumn of 2022 you would have a railway that was 90-95% of the end-to-end benefit. A further tweak is then required, probably based on National Rail timetable days, to do the final articulation of any services from the east that would go all the way through.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-57890384,2021-07-19

Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""Crossrail was further from completion than anyone understood when the Department [for Transport], TfL and Crossrail Ltd reset the programme in 2019. ""The problems we identified in our previous report have been difficult to address and have continued to affect the programme.

9,Crossrail managers blame Covid-19 for further delays,"The railway, from Berkshire to Essex, was originally set to open in December 2018 but various delays pushed it back. Crossrail said earlier: ""The impact of Covid-19 has made the existing pressures more acute."" On Tuesday the government announced it also  . Work on the project, Europe's largest transport scheme, was paused on 24 March because of coronavirus and work did not restart until 15 June. Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild said: ""Everyone working on the Crossrail project knows London needs the Elizabeth line more than ever and we are doing everything possible to deliver the railway as safely and as quickly as we can."" He added work was being done to finalise a detailed recovery plan for the remaining work. Andy Byford, London's new transport commissioner, said: ""Crossrail is a transformational project that will benefit London and beyond forever, and it is vitally important to get it over the line.

10,Crossrail: 'Forensic focus' needed to complete project,"The route was due to open in December 2018 but has faced numerous delays. A committee has urged Transport for London (TfL) to keep a ""tight grasp"" on the project's leadership and budget, which is now £18.6bn after a £825m boost of government cash in December. TfL said there had been ""many challenges"", but the line would be opened ""as soon as possible"".  Known as the Elizabeth Line, the route, running from Reading to Essex through central London, has suffered from delays, budget complexities and issues with its construction work and signalling systems over the decade. Management of the scheme was transferred from Crossrail Ltd to TfL, chaired by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, in October 2020. A cross-party London Assembly Transport Committee warned TfL and the mayor to ensure ""past mistakes are not repeated"". It also said there may not be ""enough resources or the right level of expertise"" to complete its final phases with safety assurance activities and technical processes. The inquiry noted the coronavirus pandemic had ""exacerbated resource constraints"" and created ""possible staff burnout"". Chairwoman of the Transport Committee, Alison Moore, said it was ""vital"" TfL and the mayor ""adopt a Sherlock-style forensic focus"" to deliver the project on time and on budget. She insisted Londoners ""need assurance"" that ""they will be no further out of pocket"". ""Covid-19 has understandably put increased financial and staff pressures on Crossrail opening the Elizabeth Line,"" she said. ""However there are aspects to delivering Crossrail, such as supporting employees' workloads and better forecasting project delays, that can contribute to delivering as promised."" She added it was ""imperative"" the line was ""up and running as soon as possible"".  London's transport commissioner Andy Byford said his focus ""remains on safely opening the Elizabeth line as soon as possible"". ""There have been many challenges with delivering the railway and I am confident lessons are being learned and applied in these complex final stages of delivery.

11,Crossrail: 'Unrealistic timeframe' caused delays,"Decisions were driven by a desire to meet the December 2018 deadline for the new east-west railway in London, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. Crossrail cut risk management teams ahead of an expected completion, but is now rehiring them, the NAO said. The company said it had taken the views of the watchdog ""very seriously"". The overall budget for Crossrail has risen from £14.8bn in 2010 to £17.6bn. In response to delays in the schedule, testing of train and signalling systems were carried out in early 2018 even though ""few meaningful results could be acquired at this point"" because of a software problem, the report stated. This took time away from those involved in construction work. Changes to designs and contractors' delivery schedules cost around £2.5bn between 2013 and 2018, according to the NAO's analysis. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: ""Throughout delivery, and even as pressures mounted, Crossrail Ltd clung to the unrealistic view that it could complete the programme to the original timetable, which has had damaging consequences. ""While we cannot make an overall assessment of value for money until Crossrail is complete, there have been a number of choices made in the course of this project that have clearly damaged public value."" Crossrail Ltd, the company building the railway, said services between Paddington and Abbey Wood will begin by March 2021, although Bond Street station will not be ready. Full services across the line from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east will begin ""as soon as possible"", it added.

12,Crossrail delay: 'Unacceptable' lack of accountability,"Crossrail, Europe's biggest infrastructure project, had been due to open in December 2018, but will not now open fully until 2020 at the earliest.  Three emergency cash injections have seen the cost of the route rise from £14.8bn to £17.6bn. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it ""absolutely rejects"" claims there was insufficient oversight. Both the DfT and Transport for London (TfL) are joint sponsors of the project, which is run through an ""arms-length"" body, Crossrail Ltd. A report by the Commons' Public Accounts Committee found an ""unacceptably laissez-faire"" attitude to project costs from the overlapping organisations.  The DfT and Crossrail Ltd ""are unable to fully explain how the programme has been allowed to unravel,"" the report found. All three bodies were ""unwilling to pinpoint responsibility to a single individual or entity"", the committee said. Four months before the line was due in December 2018   to allow more time for testing.  A ""fixation on a delivery deadline of December 2018"" led to warning signs being missed or ignored when the programme was in trouble, the report said. TfL estimates it will miss out on at least £20m in revenue due to the delay. Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington. When fully open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. The fall from grace for Crossrail continues.  This report raises more questions than answers about the beleaguered project and its delay.  Again there are questions about governance structures - who was in charge of what bits? - and a lack of oversight and clarity. The Dft gets particular criticism.  Londoners will also be annoyed there is still no opening date in sight - the latest news we have is that none of the stations are yet finished - and the testing of trains has hit technical problems.  Even opening in 2020 looks unlikely. It's a real, real mess.  Committee chair Meg Hillier said: ""Passengers were led to believe they would be able use new Crossrail services through central London from the end of last year. ""It is unacceptable that Parliament and the public still do not know the root causes of the failures that beset this project. ""Accountability in the use of public money is of fundamental importance.""  The Public Accounts Committee has asked for the DfT to publish an accurate governance structure for the project and ""set out clearly what consequences there have been for well-rewarded officials whose costly failures are paid for by taxpayers"". A DfT spokesperson said: ""The department consistently challenged the leadership of Crossrail Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TfL, on the delivery of this project."" ""As soon as the company admitted delay, the Department and TfL acted swiftly to identify lessons, change the leadership of the Crossrail Ltd board, and strengthen governance and oversight. "" Recently installed replacement Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild said: ""We take the views of the Public Accounts Committee very seriously and will be reviewing their recommendations carefully.  ""The Elizabeth line will be completed as quickly as possible and brought into service for passengers.  ""The team is working extremely hard to establish a new approach through the development of an earliest opening programme for the railway and we will be providing more details later this month.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-47787367,2019-04-03

""My expectation is that I will be asked to resign, and in the interests of both great programmes, that is what I will do,"" he told the BBC on Monday. He said the Crossrail programme had been put back partly because of delays in ordering the trains, which was ultimately the responsibility of the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan said: ""Not only was I angry when Crossrail informed us that the project would be delayed, but historically there has been a lack of adequate information shared by the senior Crossrail leadership with the project's joint sponsors - namely, the Department for Transport and Transport for London."" The project's budget was increased from £14.8bn to £15.4bn in July due to ""cost pressures"", and in October the Mayor of London was offered £350m of additional government funding. Allan Cook has been appointed as the new chair of HS2, and a Crossrail successor will be announced, the Department for Transport said. HS2, the government's planned £55bn high-speed rail network, promises to cut journey times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds when up and running. But there has been criticism of the project in terms of how much it is expected to cost, and its impact on the environment.

It also wants to see the extension of the Crossrail project to link up with High Speed One at Ebbsfleet.  It is calling on the government to provide £20m for the development of the rail link to be built by 2029.  The government said it will make an announcement ""within the next six months"" if it will fund any of the commission's proposals.  Under the plans there would be redevelopment work taking place in Basildon, Castle Point and Southend, with a ""new medical research corridor"" in north Kent, extending to Canterbury.  Cultural and creative industries will be encouraged to expand in the East London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Lewisham, and Bexley and Greenwich.

The commission said: ""The Thames Estuary area faces some real challenges, including significant pockets of deprivation. We believe it has the potential to support growth across the country."" James Brokenshire, Secretary of State for Communities, said: ""The Thames Estuary has enormous untapped potential and we are determined to unlock this to drive both local and national economic growth.

17,Crossrail needs extra £450m and delayed until 2022,"The route - known as the Elizabeth Line - was initially due to open in December 2018 but has faced numerous delays. Crossrail has now said the line's central section, from Paddington to Abbey Wood, would be ready to open ""in the first half of 2022"". The Mayor of London is said to be ""deeply disappointed"" with the latest delay. Transport for London's new commissioner, Andy Byford, has been asked by City Hall to review Crossrail's latest update including any extra money the project may need. Mr Byford also said the delay was ""disappointing"" and said the Department for Transport (DfT) would also look at Crossrail's plans. The government has also launched a new ""acceleration unit"" designed to speed up road and rail infrastructure upgrades. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed that a team of specialists will join the DfT to tackle delays to infrastructure projects caused by the pandemic. Crossrail's new date comes after the team behind the project said last month that the route  . Currently the trains run between Liverpool Street and Shenfield, Essex as well as between Paddington and Reading, Berkshire. There is also a line from Paddington to Heathrow operating. But the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is one of the reasons behind the new delay to completing the central section of the line, which will run mostly through tunnels. The team said social distancing meant that a maximum of 2,000 people were now allowed on Crossrail sites - less than 50% of the staffing levels before the pandemic. The project's boss said their ""focus remains on opening the Elizabeth Line as soon as possible"" and that they have a ""comprehensive plan"". Crossrail's CEO Mark Wild said the project is in its ""complex final stages"".  ""It is being completed at a time of great uncertainty due to the risks and potential impacts of further Covid outbreaks,"" he added. ""We are working tirelessly to complete the remaining infrastructure works so that we can fully test the railway and successfully transition the project as an operational railway to Transport for London."" The crucial point to remember with these ""opening dates"" is no one actually knows when Crossrail will start operating. These dates are now an educated estimate but so many dates have come and gone that no one will trust the latest one. Crossrail already had problems and due to Covid-19, inevitably construction slowed down and the complex testing of the hi-tech signalling systems will now only start in October. Train testing then starts but more problems will probably crop up. There could also be more delays due to more Covid outbreaks. Don't forget this further delay has a big knock-on on TfL's finances which are already in a dire state. It will also affect all those businesses and tenants up and down the line who have been paying increased rent on the promise of Crossrail.  Until it opens - Crossrail is shut.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53847738,2020-08-21
18,Crossrail: An extra £140m need to complete surface line,"The project, Europe's largest transport scheme, was due to open in December 2018 but has been beset by delays. The additional costs on the Network Rail-run section of the line are not related to the coronavirus pandemic. A new funding package will need to be developed with ""London as the primary beneficiary bearing the cost"", Railways Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said. Mr Heaton-Harris called the cost increase and schedule delays ""very disappointing"".   Delays in upgrades to stations and provision of power are behind the extra cost. The cost of the surface lines either side of the tunnels, run by Network Rail, now stands at just under £3bn. This is in addition to the   agreed last November for the Crossrail project as a whole. Work has now restarted on Crossrail sites following a pause due to coronavirus. The London Assembly Transport Committee said: ""We knew costs were increasing before Covid hit. It now seems almost certain that the project will be further delayed and put further into the red as a result of this crisis.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53483675,2020-07-21
19,Heathrow loses Crossrail access charge case,"The airport spent £1bn building the five-mile line 20 years ago to connect the hub to the Great Western track. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) previously decided Heathrow could not charge trains for using the line, which it said would cost about £42m a year. The airport applied for a judicial review claiming the ORR did not have the power to reach that decision. The west London airport also claimed the ORR's ruling was irrational. But, Mr Justice Ouseley said on Friday the challenge had failed on all grounds. A Heathrow spokesman said: ""We are disappointed with today's ruling and are considering our next steps. ""Both Heathrow and Network Rail agree that track access charges must be fair to encourage future private investment in the rail network."" It added it was ""committed to increasing sustainable public transport to the airport"". An ORR spokeswoman said: ""We welcome this judgment and we will now work with all the affected parties to enable Crossrail services to start running as scheduled into the airport."" Four  trains an hour will run between Paddington and Heathrow terminals 2 to 4, replacing Heathrow Connect trains from May 2018. A spokesperson for the railway regulator said the airport had proposed each train should be charged historical build costs of £597 per use and an operational expenditure charge of £138 per use. But Heathrow said the   would be £460.09 per train between 2019 and 2028.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40059659,2017-05-26
20,The archaeological legacy of the Crossrail excavations,"What's been unearthed undoubtedly offers a fascinating insight into London life over the centuries - but what will be the archaeological legacy of what is Europe's largest infrastructure project?  Tens of thousands of artefacts have been dug up during work to create the 42km (26-mile)  , which runs from the east to the west of the capital. With careful planning, 20 sites were excavated by archaeologists at locations where ventilation shafts were put in, where railways entered tunnels and where new ticket halls were to be built. ""We've managed to take a slice down through London but also across London,"" said Jackie Keily, the curator of the exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands. One of Ms Keily's favourite exhibits is a bowling ball discovered at the site of a Tudor manor house in Stepney Green.  ""It's amazing it survived,"" she said. ""It had been in a moat which was boggy. Henry VIII brought in a ban banning commoners from bowling. It was only for the aristocracy. ""Stepney Green is now part of Greater London but it would have been a weekend retreat in the countryside."" A chamber pot found beneath 19th Century terraced housing, also in Stepney Green, ranks as another highlight for Ms Keily.  ""It dates back to when there were no indoor toilets or bathrooms,"" she said. ""This one is fabulous because it has a shocked-looking man saying: 'What I see I will not tell'."" The discoveries made were by no means restricted to those from Victorian, Tudor or medieval times though, with considerably older items being unearthed, including bison bone fragments in the part of the capital we now call Royal Oak. Asked if there had been previous evidence of bison roaming there, Ms Keily said: ""We kind of knew but it's incredible to find the remains. ""There were three fragments of bison bone and one of reindeer from an antler. They were dated back to about 68,000 years ago. ""Some of the bones had traces of gnawing, possibly from wolves."" Two finds from the Crossrail project have ended up among the 80 million specimens at the Natural History Museum: a piece of 55-million-year-old amber and two parts of a woolly mammoth jawbone. Both were discovered beneath Canary Wharf.  The bone find could prove to be important, as Jessica Simpson from the museum explains: ""They can date the woolly mammoth specimen once it is off display and they might be able to determine when they became extinct in our region.  ""The last known woolly mammoths were roaming a small part of northern Siberia about 4,000 years ago."" For Ms Keily, the discovery that will perhaps provide the most significant element of Crossrail's archaeological legacy is the human remains found at Liverpool Street. DNA testing on teeth found in the 17th Century Bedlam cemetery   behind London's Great Plague for the first time. ""That's an important discovery,"" she said. And it's not the only one. Don Walker, senior human osteologist at the Museum of London Archaeology, analysed some skeletons found at Charterhouse Square in Farringdon.  He said of the discovery: ""It was important because we found documented evidence of a Black Death cemetery dating to 1348 or 1349."" Isotope, radiocarbon and DNA analysis was performed in an effort to reveal details such as how a person's diet had changed during their lifetime and where they were likely to have lived.  Mr Walker said: ""We don't know much about how infectious diseases interacted with people in the past. ""If we can understand the evolution of infectious diseases such as the plague that will help us understand how diseases will behave in the future."" Asked what the impact of the Crossrail excavations would be, he said: ""I think it goes beyond archaeology and I'm certain there will be some benefits for future medical work as well."" Dr Piers Mitchell from Cambridge University is president of the Paleopathology Association and was part of the team that found   in a Leicester car park.  Asked if Crossrail would go on to be viewed as a significant project in British archaeology, he said: ""The problem with Crossrail is you only get a little vertical shaft, a little box to excavate.  ""That gives you a little vignette of life in the past. It's a little bit frustrating. ""They've got lots of little circles and they are trying to interpret London from that."" But he added: ""Only time will tell. If interesting papers are published and we learn more about diseases of the past and how they are changing, it's going to be a good resource to teach students with."" Jay Carver, lead Crossrail archaeologist, believes the project will be held up as an example of how developers, engineers and archaeologists can work together and share finds with the community.  He said: ""Every 10 years there's a mega-project that involves a lot of archaeology; previously there was the Eurostar tunnel and then Terminal 5 at Heathrow. ""With each project we are developing the way we work with construction and engineering. In the past archaeologists and engineers have been at loggerheads. ""I think it's been a really successful project."" And it's a project that is set to continue, with plans in place for  , the proposed north-south line from Epsom in Surrey to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire.  But wherever there are huge infrastructure projects of this kind, there are difficult decisions to be taken, such as the possibility the   for a new ticket hall. Stephen Fry has said he does not want to be a ""numby"" - not under my backyard - but, as a supporter of the Curzon Soho, objects to the plans as they stand. And the Victorian Society warns Wimbledon is among the areas that   to Crossrail 2's bulldozers - although a Transport for London spokesperson said: ""Demolition is always our last resort."" Back in east London at the Museum of London Docklands - a stone's throw away from where engineers are putting the finishing touches to the Canary Wharf Crossrail station - Jackie Keily reflects happily on the impact of the several years of excavations. ""It's been an amazing project,"" she said. ""To be able to archaeologically take a slice through London east to west is pretty amazing.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-38919314,2017-02-10

In tests the front high-speed rail carriage proved itself equal to the variable British weather.  Crossrail will open in 2017 linking 40 stations in London and the South East. Named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen, it is due to open in May.   Operations director Howard Smith said: ""It's important that we check that the new trains can operate in anything that the changing British weather can throw at them and it won't be long before our customers will be able to get on board a train.""

22,Coronavirus: How realistic is Crossrail opening next year?,"Social distancing means only 13-20% of passengers can use the London Underground or buses. So the bosses at Crossrail know how urgently it is needed. But unfortunately the pandemic has slowed progress, as worked paused in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Crossrail's chief executive Mark Wild and most of his team have been working remotely. Mr Wild said: ""Whilst we have done pretty well and people are now back at work, the pandemic has had an effect and we're still quantifying that.  ""We understand, more than ever, London needs a line like the Elizabeth Line cutting across London.  ""Big stations, big trains, easier to have social distancing on our stations."" Crossrail is a new railway that will run beneath London from Reading and Heathrow in the west through central tunnels across to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Construction began in 2009 and it is Europe's biggest infrastructure project - it had been due to open in December 2018 although that was pushed back to 2021. It has been officially named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen and will serve 41 stations. An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes. The project was originally supposed to be finished in December 2018 but has suffered several setbacks. Earlier this year Crossrail Ltd admitted that the line would probably not open until the spring of 2021, and  Parts of the route, named the Elizabeth Line, are running already, but the central section is yet to open. The cost of the project could reach £18.25bn, more than £2bn more than the original budget. Back in March, 60% of safety testing on things like fire systems and platform doors had been completed. Now work has resumed again on site with social distancing.  That means the number of workers on site has been reduced down to a quarter and so the work takes longer.  What's called the ""dynamic testing"" of the trains has started again.  The purpose of that is to identify and fix any software bugs in the train control system and to make sure everything works as planned. The target is to be able to start ""trial running"" this year. That is, run the trains as close together as they would in normal service. That is crucial if the service hopes to open by next summer. There is also two to three months of work left to do on the three different signalling systems. But the big challenge is the 40% of work left to do on the safety checks known as ""assurances"". The management team say it is working to the opening date of the summer 2021 for the Paddington to Abbey Wood section under central London. To make up for lost time, Crossrail wants to carry out blitz testing in August and September.  I asked Mr Wild if he could guarantee 100% if Crossrail will open in summer 2021. He said: ""I guarantee that this project team and myself, will do everything humanly possible to do it.  ""I must say we are working pretty effectively - 2,500 people working off-site and we are making great progress on the assurance work. ""Clearly we have to do that safely but there's no doubt Covid has had an effect and we are working now on a plan to recover lost ground."" I'd say that is realistic.  There is no doubt that many in the transport industry have doubts about the feasibility of mass transit.  Not only are there concerns about funding but will these big infrastructure projects still be needed in the future? Particularly if behaviour has changed and we see more home-working for example, or people staying local. Mr Wild is cautiously optimistic, saying: ""I think it's far too early to say what the long-term effects of this [pandemic] will be.  ""I have no doubt that Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2 will still be required.  ""This will affect how people work but I remain not really convinced we won't need mass transit.  ""No matter what I think, Covid-19 will pass and human beings want to agglomerate, they want to be with people, they want to drink with people, have meals with people, they want to socialise - so I think its too early to tell.

23,Liverpool Street platforms on Crossrail line completed,"Liverpool Street station's new platforms have been built 37m (121ft) below ground and are twice as long as most London Underground stations. The route, which will be called the Elizabeth line, links 40 stations across London and the South East. Crossrail Limited, which is running the project, said 75% of the line has now been constructed. Whitechapel station is the only central London station on the new line where platforms have not been laid. The platforms at Liverpool Street station are made up of over 500 pieces, which were built in a factory near Sheffield. These were transported to the capital, lowered down through the station's main shaft and fitted into place. Rohan Perin, Crossrail's project manager at Liverpool Street station said it was ""a bit like putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle"". Work has begun on fitting out the stations with equipment and systems to operate the line. Services will run from the station from December 2018.

24,Megacity London will 'grind to halt' without Crossrail 2,"The north-east to south-west railway, which would tunnel beneath central London, could be running by 2033. It would link Hertfordshire and Surrey, passing through Tottenham Hale, Euston-St Pancras, Tottenham Court Road, Victoria and Clapham Junction. But plans for a new station at Chelsea could be axed to save money. A planned branch to New Southgate could also be delayed in order to save £4bn. Lord Adonis, the interim chairman of the Commission, said that by the 2030s London would be home to more than 10m people, meeting the definition of a ""megacity"". He said: ""Even allowing for planned investment and the imminent arrival of the East-West Crossrail line, the capital will grind to a halt unless significant further improvements are made."" He said London should pay more than half the estimated £32.6bn cost of the line and that private financing should help to meet the cost of building stations. Lord Adonis said at least 200,000 homes should be built along the route. The report identifies the Upper Lee Valley, which currently has poor transport connections, as a potential site for new housing. The   campaign, which has lobbied against a Crossrail 2 station in Chelsea, said: ""It is clear there is no transport or business case for a Chelsea Crossrail 2 station,"" said Chris Lenon, chair of the campaign.  ""Spending more than £1bn on the richest part of London, when so many other places in our great city require investment, is ludicrous.  ""Crossrail 2 is a great project. We support it. But plans to build a massive new station in the heart of Chelsea must be scrapped."" But a group backed by organisations including the Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum, Imperial College London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and several local MPs, wrote to the mayor of London and Transport for London calling for a Crossrail station in Chelsea. In January's letter it said: ""Enhancing Kensington and Chelsea's transport connections and linking to future major transport infrastructure will safeguard the area's status as a world-leading cultural hub and location for pioneering medical, research and educational establishments.  ""Crucially, it will assist us in recruiting and retaining the very best staff by expanding the area within reasonable commuting distance, as well as improving transport options for our users: visitors, students, patients, customers and local communities.""

Mr Tkacik was crushed by wet concrete. BAM Nuttall, Ferrovial Agroman (UK), and Keir Infrastructure and Overseas will appear in court in January. Mr Tkacik, 44, of Hackney Road, east London, was killed at the Crossrail site in Holborn when nearly a tonne of concrete was poured on him. Mr Hughes suffered severe leg injuries when he was crushed by a tipper truck between the Bond Street and Paddington section of the tunnel on the 16 January 2015 .  Alex Vizitiu was working in the same stretch of the tunnel on 22 January 2015.  He suffered head and hip injuries when he was struck by a high pressure mixture of water and concrete during a routine operation to clean concrete lines. An inquest into the death of Mr Tkacik, held in February last year, heard he was a ""hugely experienced"" worker. St Pancras Coroner's Court was told he was working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter, Esther, to go to university.

26,Budget 2016: Chancellor gives Crossrail 2 green light,"The   approved the north-east to south-west railway plan last week, saying London would ""grind to a halt"" without it. The Treasury will provide £80m to develop Crossrail 2 and Transport for London will match the figure. But Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan called it an ""anti-London budget"". Chancellor Mr Osborne joked at Jeremy Corbyn's expense: ""I know this commitment to Crossrail 2 will be warmly welcomed by the Leader of the Opposition, the Right Honourable Member for Islington. ""It could have been designed just for him, because it's good for all those who live in north London and are heading south."" Mr Osborne said the Greater London Authority would ""move towards full retention of its business rates from next April, three years early."" At the moment, councils have to return up to half the business rates they collect to the Treasury for redistribution. The change means the GLA will be able to spend business rates as it sees fit. The Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and the party's candidate to succeed him as mayor, Zac Goldsmith, had argued ""passionately"" for the change, the chancellor said. Sadiq Khan, Labour's mayoral candidate, tweeted: ""Shocked that the budget contains nothing to fix London's housing crisis."" He added: ""This was also another anti-London Budget. What have the Tories got against Londoners? ""London's schools, councils and public services face bigger cuts than anywhere else in the UK. And rather than getting the green light for Crossrail 2, we got an amber light at best."" Sian Berry, the Greens' mayoral candidate, said she ""welcomed"" the Crossrail approval but said the Treasury would only pay half the cost and the next mayor would need plans to raise the rest. The chancellor announced £115m would be spent to reduce homelessness and rough sleeping. Recent figures revealed a quarter of England's rough sleepers were in London, with the number up 30% in the past year. The cash will be spent on providing 2,000 accommodation places for people leaving hostels, with £10m for prevention projects. The British Library's plans to develop land to the north of its site in St Pancras will be supported ""subject to business case approval"", the Budget said.

There will be four dedicated wheelchair spaces on each train, and all platforms and trains across the Crossrail network will have step-free access. Tunnelling for the route began in 2012 and finished in June this year, with eight boring machines cutting their way through earth to create 26 miles (42km) of tunnels.

The council's cabinet member for environment and planning Mike Goodman said with Surrey train services   in the country, it was essential to do everything possible to meet rising passenger demand. He said 130,000 Surrey residents travelled into London by train each day and many never got a seat. ""We believe it should go into more places and we're looking at Woking and Guildford,"" he said. The study commissioned by the council will be published next month, he added. He said: ""What I'm urging Crossrail to do is to listen to this research, because we believe it could be positive news for our Surrey residents."" Mr Goodman said Crossrail 2 would not be finished until 2030 but added: ""What we must do is plan it now. We've got one of the best economies in Surrey, so the justification is to come to Surrey.""

The prime minister, London mayor Boris Johnson and transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin walked through the tunnel at Farringdon to take a closer look at the tunnelling machine. Mr Johnson said the completion was ""an historic day"" and marked ""a huge success for the whole of the UK economy"". Construction of Crossrail began at Canary Wharf in London Docklands on 15 May 2009, with tunnelling work starting in May 2012. At the peak of construction machines were aiming to complete 100 metres of tunnelling a week. The fastest day of tunnelling was on 16 April 2014 when boring machine Ellie completed 236ft (72m) between Pudding Mill Lane and Stepney Green.  Crossrail's tunnels are made up of more than 200,000 concrete tunnel segments, with each weighing 3.4 tonnes. Millions of tonnes of excavated material is being shipped to   to create a nature reserve.

Crossrail said the new bridge was the largest single-span bridge installed on the Great Western railway since the days of Brunel.  It is hoped the bridge will ensure services to central London can join the Great Western Main Line without delays. Matthew White, surface director at Crossrail, said: ""Installing the first section of Crossrail track is a major milestone for the project.  ""The flyover at Stockley will provide a vital new link between Heathrow and London, significantly improving connections between the airport and the West End, the City and Canary Wharf."" From late 2019, passengers will be able to travel from Heathrow through the centre of the London without changing trains, as Crossrail comes into full service. Up to four Crossrail trains an hour are due to link Heathrow with central London.  Passengers are expected to be able to reach Bond Street in 26 minutes and Canary Wharf in 40 minutes. Network Rail is responsible for the design, development and delivery of the parts of Crossrail that are on the existing network.  Matthew Steele, Crossrail programme director at Network Rail said: ""Once Crossrail is operational, this brand new structure will enable us to increase the number of rail services between central London and Heathrow airport.  ""After four years of planning is it great to see this new infrastructure being brought into service. Well done to everyone involved."" The Crossrail route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km (62 miles) from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21km (13-mile) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-30173787,2014-11-24
33,All Crossrail stations to have 'step-free' access,"Langley in Berkshire, and Taplow and Iver stations, in Buckinghamshire, will receive £14m to make them accessible. This means all 40 Crossrail stations will now have step-free access by the time trains are running across the network by December 2019. Transport for All, which has campaigned for step-free access across Crossrail, said it was ""delighted"". Trains will start running through central London between Paddington and Abbey Wood by December 2018. ""I am delighted to confirm the funding of these important accessibility improvements,"" said transport minister Baroness Susan Kramer. ""This is another example of our commitment to build a world-class rail network that is open to all,"" she added. Transport for All director Faryal Velmi said: ""We have campaigned for over a year-and-a-half for this and are delighted. ""It was scandalous to think a new rail line was to be built that was not going to be fully accessible,"" she added. ""Common sense prevailed."" The government's investment package builds on Transport for London's announcement in October that it would fund step-free access at Seven Kings, Maryland, Manor Park stations, in east London, and Hanwell station, in west London.  The £14.8bn Crossrail project is set to boost London's rail capacity by 10%, with up to 24 trains per-hour each carrying up to 1,500 passengers in the central section between Paddington and Whitechapel during peak hours. By the time the line is fully operational it will link parts of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, via central London, to Essex and south-east London.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-30093378,2014-11-18
34,"Crossrail 2 cost rises by almost a third, says TfL","The 30% increase, of £6.6bn, has been due to the inclusion of costs for new trains and surface works, figures show. It means the north-south rail scheme is now expected to cost £20bn for the shorter Metro route and £27.5bn for the longer regional option. A decision is expected in early 2015 between the Metro and regional routes. Crossrail 2 would run from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire to Epsom in Surrey, passing through central London via stations at Tottenham Court Road, Victoria, Chelsea and Clapham Junction. Construction could begin in 2017 if proposals are approved. Consultants Mott MacDonald estimated in 2012 the entire scheme would cost £20.9bn, but the increase in costs has been shown in  . It suggests that money from fares could be used to meet the cost increase, but funding may also come from extending the business rate supplement brought in for Crossrail 1 and the mayor's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) - a tax on London land owners and developers used to bring in money for big infrastructure projects. Other options included in the document include a possible council tax rise, similar to that used to help cover the cost of the 2012 Olympics, and further payments from landowners and property developments near the new line. These measures combined could provide over half of the scheme's cost, reducing the burden on the UK taxpayer overall, PwC said. Val Shawcross, transport spokesperson for the London Assembly Labour Group, said it ""makes sense"" for Londoners to contribute to the scheme's cost. ""[But] it is only right that a significant portion of the funding comes from central government and that the cost of Crossrail 2 is not unfairly shouldered by London taxpayers."" A preferred route for Crossrail 2 scheme was announced in October by mayor Boris Johnson, who said the project was vital to support the capital's growth. The scheme would complement the £14.8bn east-west Crossrail scheme, which is currently being built and scheduled to be operational by 2018. Supporters say Crossrail 2 would slash journey times across London, with a journey from Kingston, in south-west London, to Tottenham Court Road being completed in 29 minutes - 17 minutes less than today. But concern has been raised about the location of a new station in Chelsea along the proposed Crossrail 2 route. Residents of the Cremorne Estate on the King's Road argue demolition of housing may be needed if it is chosen as the location of the Chelsea West station. The current proposed station location is further east, near the fire station on the King's Road, and received the majority of support in this summer's consultation.

36,'Risks remain' on multi-billion Crossrail project,"The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said it was a ""textbook example of how to get things right"". However, they added there could be risks in managing the transition from building the railway to operating it. Rail minister Claire Perry said she had ""every confidence"" Crossrail would be completed on time. The line, which is due to be finished by 2019, will see trains running from Reading in Berkshire to the west of the capital and as far east as Shenfield in Essex. The committee said the Crossrail programme was proceeding well and was on course to deliver value for money to the taxpayer. However the MPs warned ""with construction incomplete, considerable risks remain in delivering the programme by 2019, particularly managing the transition from building the railway to operating it, and delivering the Crossrail trains"". The report added that Crossrail had a benefit-cost ratio of less than 2:1, meaning that for every £1 spent there would be a £2.10 benefit - however a ratio of 4:1 is considered to offer good value for money. The committee also said the Department for Transport had not fully realised how the scheme would benefit London businesses, meaning that it had mixed success in securing contributions from businesses. Heathrow Airport would now only provide £70m, which is less than a third of the funding it had originally agreed, MPs said.   Crossrail infrastructure is due to cost £14.8bn and its trains will cost a further £1bn.  Committee member Richard Bacon praised the delivery of the project, but said lessons needed to be learned about how to appraise transport projects. ""Major, complex infrastructure projects are notoriously difficult to deliver on time and in budget. With Crossrail we see a textbook example of how to get things right,"" the Conservative MP said.   Rail Minister Claire Perry said: ""We have every confidence that Crossrail will be completed on time and, alongside Transport for London, we are working closely with the delivery company, Crossrail Ltd, to ensure it meets its construction timetable.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28424273,2014-07-23

The jury ruled his death had accidental contributory factors including him not being able to understand all briefings.  The exclusion zone definition was also unclear as it sometimes changed. St Pancras Coroner's Court heard Mr Tkacik was found within an exclusion zone where wet concrete was being poured, which had not been clearly marked at the time of his death.  The jury had learned that Mr Tkacik, of Hackney Road, east London, was a ""hugely experienced"" worker. He had been working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter Esther to go to university. The jury was shown a digital reconstruction of the 80ft (24m) deep tunnel in Fisher Street, Holborn, where Mr Tkacik died. The tunnel was so deep it took an emergency team six minutes to reach him from ground level, the court heard. His wife Renata Tkacikova, said: ""Rene was a loving husband and father - we miss him very much. ""I have struggled without him. I do not feel that I have come to terms with my loss and I do not understand how this incident could have happened.

It would pass through central London via places including Tottenham Court Road, Victoria, Chelsea and Clapham Junction. If proposals are approved, construction could begin in 2017. Setting out the case for the line in a speech at the City Age conference, the mayor said: ""With London's population soon to surpass its previous 1939 peak of 8.6 million and with more people travelling by Tube and rail than ever before, we need additional rail capacity to support future growth. ""For the capital to remain globally competitive, there needs to be continued investment in our transport network and that's why we have to get cracking on planning for Crossrail 2."" The scheme would complement the £14.8bn east-west Crossrail scheme, currently being built and scheduled to be operational by 2018. Supporters say it will slash journey times across London, with a journey from Kingston, in south-west London, to Tottenham Court Road being completed in 29 minutes -  17 minutes faster than today. Those travelling between Dalston, in north-east London and Tottenham Court Road would have an eight-minute journey - 19 minutes faster than today.  Mr Johnson said he was confident the private sector could, in the right circumstances, contribute to well over half the cost of Crossrail 2. Labour Assembly Member Val Shawcross said the announcement of a preferred route was ""a big step forward"" but added: ""What we need to see now is the fully worked-up funding package which will make this project a reality.""

41,Crossrail extension to Hertfordshire being considered,"Extending the service would reduce journey times between London and parts of Hertfordshire by up to 16 minutes.  At Crossrail's Farringdon site in central London, Mr McLoughlin said the plans would also provide an opportunity to redevelop Euston station. Business groups in the area said an extension would drive economic growth. Mr McLoughlin said the proposals would take the pressure off the Tube's busiest sections and make it easier to improve Euston - which will have 11 new platforms built under proposals for the HS2 high-speed rail project between London and the West Midlands - because it currently ""isn't up to scratch"". Under the plans, the current Crossrail project would be extended through north west London to stations including Tring, Hemel Hempstead, Watford Junction, Berkhamsted and Harrow and Wealdstone. Addressing Crossrail workers at Farringdon, Mr McLoughlin said: ""We're going to examine, right away, how we can run extra services direct into the city and through to Canary Wharf from key stations like Tring, Hemel Hempstead, Harrow and Watford, without the frustrating need to change at Euston. ""I have made clear to my department that any changes must not affect the timetable or planned service pattern for the existing Crossrail scheme.

Yolanda Rugg, chief executive officer at the Hertfordshire Chamber of Commerce, said including Hertfordshire in the scheme would be ""a catalyst to drive economic growth"" in the area.  ""It will provide vital high-speed transport connectivity from London to the new Watford Health Campus, and to the financial and creative services sectors,"" she said.

51,Is Crossrail 2 a bridge too far for regions?,"It comes as Tory MPs outside London are voicing concerns about further investment in major transport infrastructure in the capital at the expense of other parts of the country. Mr Osborne believes work on the existing £16bn Crossrail should be completed first - in 2018 - before he considers further major transport schemes for London. It indicates there will be no support for Crossrail 2 when the government publishes its spending review next month - outlining departmental budget limits for the next three years - and will add to speculation that the capital's transport budget may face significant cuts. The former Transport Secretary Lord Andrew Adonis, who is heading the campaign for Crossrail 2, described the approach as ""short-termist"". Last week, Mr Osborne visited the Crossrail construction site near the Olympic park in east London. One of the project's engineers told him he hoped to go on and work on a second Crossrail after the first was completed. Mr Osborne told him, ""They want me to build Crossrail 2. Let's finish Crossrail 1 first and then we will look at other projects."" Supporters of Crossrail 2 - which would run north-south through London from Hertfordshire to Surrey - say preparatory work needs to start soon if it is to be completed by 2030. Lord Adonis told the BBC it was necessary to convince the chancellor that it made sense to ensure a seamless transition from Crossrail 1 to Crossrail 2 to capitalise on the ready workforce and the available tunnelling and engineering expertise. He argues there is a particular need for investment in north-south routes, and by 2030 the Victoria, Northern and Piccadilly Lines - already overcrowded at times - would be under massive pressure from growing passenger numbers. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. ""The alternative is a patch-and-mend job. But even if you do that now, you will only have to build Crossrail 2 eventually anyway,"" he said. Mayor Boris Johnson said Crossrail 2 was being ""seriously considered"" by the Treasury and that it was the timing of it at issue. But he said despite being a ""passionate optimist"" he thought Crossrail 2 would most likely be a separate project starting ""as early as 2019"".  A report, commissioned by business organisation London First, says Crossrail 2 is essential to reduce journey times, tackle over-crowding, relieve pressure on the tube and south-west overground rail routes and promote economic growth - especially in the Lea Valley in north-east London. But there are signs of growing resentment among Tory backbenchers at Westminster at what they perceive to have been favourable treatment of the capital over recent years. Last week in Parliament, David Mowat, Conservative MP for Warrington South, attacked the London mayor's pursuit of a second Crossrail project, saying London gets too much taxpayers' money for public transport. Prompted by claims by Boris Johnson that ""momentum"" was growing for Crossrail 2, he demanded a parliamentary debate before any money was approved even for preparatory work on a new rail line. Earlier Mr Mowat said: ""I think there is a view, which may or may not be fair, that the Department for Transport finds it easier to allocate money to London. ""London is our capital city and we're all proud of London and want it to continue to prosper. But there other parts of the country that need transport spending as well including my constituency. ""I'm keen to make sure CR2 comes under scrutiny like HS2 and also keen to put it on policy maker's agendas that there are other parts of the country that need infrastructure and parts that are not as strong as London. ""It is true to say London has higher capital spend per head than other parts of the country and it also has higher current spending per head than other parts of the country."" Eric Ollerenshaw, former leader of the Conservatives on the London Assembly and now MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said one of the government's priorities was to rebalance the economy between the north and south, and funding for Crossrail 2 could leave their regions short of investment. Northampton South MP Brian Binley, who was a member of the Crossrail parliamentary committee, said, ""Enough money's been spent on London already. ""I support Crossrail and want it to get moving as quickly as possible but I don't think there needs to be any money spent on Crossrail 2."" Lord Adonis accepted that investment in London transport was becoming increasingly ""politically contentious"" ahead of the Chancellor's spending review next month which will outline departmental budgets for the next three years. He said it was important for a strong case to be put together, backed by a partnership between the mayor, local authorities and London businesses. ""There is a strong view in the DfT that London has done very well recently,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22613813,2013-05-21
52,Sacked Crossrail electrician Frank Morris reinstated,"Frank Morris was dismissed in September 2012 and he believed the reason was because of trade union activity. He had stood up for a colleague working on the Olympic site. The Unite union and the Crossrail consortium Bam Ferrovial Kier (BFK) said in a joint statement that matters had been ""successfully concluded"". The statement added: ""BFK and Unite have agreed to work together to continue the provision of transparent working practices including safeguarding the right of workers to choose whether or not to join a trade union. ""BFK and Unite agree that there has been no contravention of the blacklisting regulations on the BFK Crossrail projects."" In 2012 Frank Morris was working as an electrician for a subcontractor on the £15bn London Crossrail link, Europe's largest construction project.  that within weeks of starting work he was identified as a union man and the company he was working for had its contract withdrawn.  Panorama tracked down a man who worked alongside Mr Morris on the site.  He was afraid to give an interview for fear of losing work, but said he firmly believed that Mr Morris was singled out because he was on a blacklist. Andrew Wolstenholme, Crossrail chief executive, said: ""Blacklisting is indefensible, unacceptable and unlawful.  ""Unite has now issued a joint statement with our western tunnels contractor BFK stating that no blacklisting has taken place."" Dave Smith, secretary of the Blacklist Support Group, said: ""We are no longer prepared to sit back when our best activists are victimised and blacklisted.  ""The reinstatement of Frank Morris is a kick in the teeth for the blacklisting firms and a turning point in industrial relations in the construction industry.  ""This is a historic union victory.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23947650,2013-09-03
